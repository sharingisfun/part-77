Since its release at the GOTJ, this EP has become a cult-classic as well as a must-own CD for any fan of underground music! This album also features artists JellyRoll, David Ray, Liquid Assassin, Scum, T-Razor, PSYCHOjesus, KidCrusher, Mars, Kung Fu Vampire, Sutter Kain, Grewsum &amp; more!\n\n\n\n\nThe Underground Avengers are a newly formed group made up from three existing hip-hop artists:  Boondox, Bukshot, and Claas.  Boondox- A Covington, GA native, is best known for releasing albums for the last six years with the undergrounds most notorious record label, Psychopathic Records.  Bukshot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The biggest independent artist to ever come out of the state of Kentucky having sold over 150,000 records in his career.  Claas Ã¢â‚¬â€œ An independent artist out of Dallas, TX who has been on the grind in the Underground scene for many years and is most well-known for his appearance on Psychopathic Records Tunnel Runners project. \n\nThe Underground Avengers were formed when these three artists entertained the idea of working with each other on separate projects and songs.  This idea transformed into one major collaborative project instead.  Much like the popular Marvel comics Avengers story line, where the super heroes from many different story lines within the Marvel universe unite together to fight against a common enemy.  These rappers were three completely different artists within the underground music universe.  With the idea of different super heroes coming together to serve a single purpose and the fact they all are considered well known and respected artists in the wicked underground, The Underground Avengers were formed!\n\n \n\nTrack listing\n\nAssemble\nJuggernaut\nKing Kong\nFace on the Asphalt\niRep\nThe Anthem\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just saying\nSimple man\nExit wounds\n\n\n\nTrack by track review and rating\n\nAssemble: Sounds of machines assembling.  Intro is only :20 N/A\nJuggernaut:  Nice Avengers sound clip at the beginning.A slow plodding beat with a great hook.  Boondox, Bukshot, and Claas all absolutely killed the beat.  Great first track to the album.  9/10\nKing Kong:  The verses are great and the hook is decent but the high pitched sound over the beat is very distracting.  Nice throwback to the original King Kong from the 1933 film.  8/10\nFace on the asphalt:  The beat hits really hard in this track.  Claas starts off the track very well.  The hook being sung instead of rapped is a very nice change for the album.  8/10\niRep:  Good verses and a lackluster hook donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help the slow beat in this track.  The track itself is a rep your city track.  6/10\nThe Anthem:  Great beat and an extremely catchy hook.  Boondox and Bukshot kill this track with pure fire on their verses.  8/10\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m just saying:  A very descriptive track over a driving beat.  This is all about hooking up and yes the scenes are laid out very well by the artists.  8/10\nSimple man:  A southern rock track that pays great tribute sound wise to the area of the country the guys come from.  All around very enjoyable track.  8/10\nExit Wounds:  This is a nine minute track that gives a ton of underground artists a chance to shine.  They include GrewSum, Whitney Peyton, Psycho Jesus, Sutter Kain aka DJ Bless, R.O.C., Ronnie Blaze, Liquid Assassin, KidCrusher (Official), SCUM, Darko, Jason Porter, MARS, Kung Fu Vampire, Ajax, &amp; F. Dux.  All of the artists do very well but the stand outs for me would be GrewSum, Liquid Assassin, and Mars.  This is an awesome track to end the album with.  A great way to give exposure to many artists who have earned the opportunity to be included in this track.  9/10\n\nConclusion: This is one of the best CDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the year.  It stands alone as a great example of the underground movement.  Boondox, Bukshot, and Claas did the underground proud with this release.  Anyone who has yet to hear it is missing out.  You should buy a copy, find a copy, or steal this CD it will not disappoint.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:006c02db51a90d720265399865f1c862c6ffbd1e","amp;dn":"The+Underground+Avengers+-+EP+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"006c02db51a90d720265399865f1c862c6ffbd1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,108,2,219,81,169,13,114,2,101,57,152,101,241,200,98,198,255,189,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
