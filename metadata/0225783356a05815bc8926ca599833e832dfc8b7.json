Their music is beyond description. There are laughs and crazy\nvocalizations, sometimes chattering of musical instruments like monkeys in\ntrees, birds in the jungle, maybe pigs, possibly horses, sometimes\nincomprehensible and a seemingly pointless scattering of notes that never\nreally evolve into phrases. The band, Mokuto, consists of three great Danish\nmusicians, Lotte Anker on saxophone, Peter Ole JÃƒÂ¸rgensen on drums and Peter\nFriis Nielsen on bass, occasionally performing as a quartet, and here, as on\ntheir previous release in the company of trumpet-player Herb Robertson. The\nastonishing fact of this album, is that out of the absurdity of it all, out of\nthe weirdness and otherworldliness, a sensitive beauty emerges, almost\norganically, naturally, ... and while the lead instruments are responsible for\nmost of that fragile beauty, it is Nielsen's bass that creates the most\ndistinct sound, creating little percolating sounds on his bass, giving it a\nsolid backbone and drive without falling into any fixed rhythmic pattern. And\nthe same holds true for JÃƒÂ¸rgensen's percussion: it's crisp and fresh and\nunpredictable, it emphasizes and accentuates and creates depth, and it drives\nthe music forward, yet without there being any distinct beat. I had listened to\ntheir previously released &quot;Message For The Errand Boy&quot;, an album that did not\nstrike as worth reviewing, yet I went back to it and I must review my\nopinion. Very unusual and very rewarding beautiful music, for those with open\nears and open minds.\n\n--\n\nBy Ken Waxman &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jazzword.com/review/126892&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jazzword.com/review/126892&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0225783356a05815bc8926ca599833e832dfc8b7","amp;dn":"Mokuto+-+Dressed+Like+A+Horse+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0225783356a05815bc8926ca599833e832dfc8b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,37,120,51,86,160,88,21,188,137,38,202,89,152,51,232,50,223,200,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
