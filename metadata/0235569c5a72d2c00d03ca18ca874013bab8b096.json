The fact is, these mysterious magnetic tapes, which capture the voices of the dead, and were recorded by the Baltic scientist Konstantin Raudive, are not a fiction but a reality (we are not here to judge their scientific objectivity ). These tapes, as rare as Lovecraft's Necronomicon, are now in our archives.\n\nWHO WAS RAUDIVE ?\nDr. Konstantin Raudive, a student of Carl Jung, was a Latvian psychologist who taught at the University of Uppsala, Sweden, before devoting the last ten years of his life to electronic voice phenomenon (EVP). He published his book Breakthrough in 1971. His early collaborator F. Jurgenson, whom he met by the very beginning of 1965, awakened Dr. Raudive's interest in EVP research. Raudive spent endless hours for the thorough study of Jurgenson's books (&quot;Voices from Space&quot;, 1964, and &quot;Radio-Link with the Dead&quot;, 1967). From an overwhelming database (ranging about 72,000 samples!), Raudive's mother seems to be statistically the most frequently reported contact personality. She usually addressed her son in the Latgalian dialect.\n\nWHAT WE CAN FIND IN THAT RECORD ?\n1. A self introduction of Konstantin Raudive and a large session of exemples from his archives - July 17, 1965)\n\n2. 9 extracts from the Gerhard Stempnik experiments - musician of the Berlin Philharmonic and close friend of Raudive (tapes from 1980)\n\n3. A Raudive celebration including unpublished material by Scanner, Paul D. Miller aka dj Spooky/That subliminal kid, Calla, Lee Ranaldo (of Sonic Youth), Ensemble, Ramdom Inc., David Toop, Carl Michael von Hausswolff and Brett Dean. They have all composed an exclusive piece of music based on the Raudive material. It goes from a close examination of the material itself (CM Von Hausswolff, Lee Ranaldo) to a more evocative mood (Calla, Scanner, dj Spooky). The last piece, for viola solo, is a global homage to all the explorators of the unknown.\nEdited by Guy Marc Hinant\n\n^*^*^*^*^*^\n\nfrom wikipedia: \n\nKonstantins Raudive (1909Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1974) was a Latvian writer and intellectual, and husband of Zenta Maurina. Raudive was born in Latvia but studied extensively abroad, later becoming a student of Carl Jung.[1] In exile following the Soviet re-conquest of Latvia in World War II, he taught at the University of Uppsala in Sweden.\nRaudive studied parapsychology all his life, and was especially interested in the possibility of the afterlife. He and German parapsychologist Hans Bender investigated Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP). He published a book on EVP, Breakthrough in 1971. Raudive was a scientist as well as a practising Roman Catholic.\n\n\nEVP research\nIn 1964, Raudive read Friedrich Jurgenson's book, Voices from Space, and was so impressed by it that he arranged to meet Jurgenson in 1965. He then worked with Jurgenson to make some EVP recordings, but their first efforts bore little fruit, although they believed that they could hear very weak, muddled voices. According to Raudive, however, one night, as he listened to one recording, he clearly heard a number of voices. When he played the tape over and over, he came to believe he understood all of them. He thought some of which were in German, some in Latvian, some in French. The last voice on the tape, according to Raudive, a woman's voice, said &quot;Va dormir, Margarete&quot; (&quot;Go to sleep, Margaret&quot;).\nRaudive later wrote (in his book Breakthrough):\n&quot;These words made a deep impression on me, as Margarete Petrautzki had died recently, and her illness and death had greatly affected me.&quot;\nRaudive started researching such alleged voices on his own and spent much of the last ten years of his life exploring EVP. With the help of various electronics experts he recorded over 100,000 audiotapes, most of which were made under what he described as &quot;strict laboratory conditions.&quot; He collaborated at times with Bender. Over 400 people were involved in his research, and all apparently heard the voices. This culminated in the 1968 publication of Unhorbares wird horbar (Ã¢â‚¬Å“What is inaudible becomes audibleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) [2](published in English in 1971 as Breakthrough).\n\n\nRaudive developed several different approaches to recording EVP:\nMicrophone voices: one simply leaves the tape recorder running, with no one talking; he indicated that one can even disconnect the microphone.\nRadio voices: one records the white noise from a radio that is not tuned to any station.\nDiode voices: one records from what is essentially a crystal set not tuned to a station.\n\n\nEVP characteristics\n\nRaudive delineated a number of characteristics of the voices, (as laid out in Breakthrough):\n&quot;The voice entities speak very rapidly, in a mixture of languages, sometimes as many as five or six in one sentence.&quot;\n&quot;They speak in a definite rhythm, which seems forced on them.&quot;\n&quot;The rhythmic mode imposes a shortened, telegram-style phrase or sentence.&quot;\nProbably because of this, &quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ grammatical rules are frequently abandoned and neologisms abound.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0235569c5a72d2c00d03ca18ca874013bab8b096","amp;dn":"Konstantin_Raudive_the_Voices_of+the_Dead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0235569c5a72d2c00d03ca18ca874013bab8b096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,53,86,156,90,114,210,192,13,3,202,24,202,135,64,19,186,184,176,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
