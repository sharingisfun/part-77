Light My Way\n\n\nOn his second full-length release, Denison Witmer again proves that he knows his way around the standard singer/songwriter song, wrapping nakedly confessional verse around light melodies and laid-back arrangements. As if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spent the last few years mainlining James Taylor and Dan FogelbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cumulative Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s work, Witmer is an almost awkwardly honest lyricist, with his unassuming croon cast as the perfect vehicle for his introspective musings. Commonplace, yet entirely well-assembled, with an impressive cast of musicians contributing bass, drums, mellotron, piano, and backup vocals to flesh out the contemplative din of streamlined autumnal sounds, it becomes somewhat apparent that WitmerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talent as an arranger is outstripping his abilities as a communicator at this stage in his career. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hardly a complaint, as his lean folk-pop approach is generally quite engaging, regardless of any perceived lack of punch. Overall, Witmer presents himself as a well-endowed artist who only has to grow a bit to fully develop his considerable gifts\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03ab81f6703958f986f64d9d2ffe1400b0027aa7","amp;dn":"Denison+Witmer+-+Of+Joy+%26amp%3B+Sorrow+%5B2001%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03ab81f6703958f986f64d9d2ffe1400b0027aa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,171,129,246,112,57,88,249,134,246,77,157,47,254,20,0,176,2,122,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
