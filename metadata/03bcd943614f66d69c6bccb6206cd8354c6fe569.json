His father owns a restaurant, and one day, he is threatened by the mob to pay a part of his profits. As the mob exits, Jackie enters the scene and rushes out the door to catch up with them. He answers back by taking them on and eventually catches the eye of the mob for his unique and talented fighting abilities. In effect, he is forced to join the Battle Creek Brawl fight in Texas. The mob promises to return his brother's fiancÃƒÂ¨e and give him the prize money as long as Jackie wins the tournament. Jackie gets help from a kung-fu teacher and uncle who trains for the Battle Creek Brawl. They focus on Jackie's speed and agility as he must fight very tough opponents, one of them including Billy Kiss, the big, bulky, unbeatable winner from previous battles who kisses his opponents after they are defeated.\n\n\nGeneral Info\n\nName:Battle Creek Brawl - Chi Tocca il Giallo muore (1980) [1080 H.264].mkv\nFormat:Matroska\nVideo Codec:H.264\nFile Size:8,734,418,968 bytes (8329.791039 MiB)\nDuration:01:54:33 (6872.875 s)\nBit rate:10000.241852 kbps\nWidth:1280 pixels\nHeight:1080 pixels\nFps:24 Fps\nDisplay aspect ratio:16:9\nAudio language:Ita\nBit rate:16-bit\nChannels:2\nSampling rate:48000 Hz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03bcd943614f66d69c6bccb6206cd8354c6fe569","amp;dn":"Battle+Creek+Brawl+-+Chi+Tocca+il+Giallo+Muore+%281980%29+%5B1080p+Ita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03bcd943614f66d69c6bccb6206cd8354c6fe569","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,188,217,67,97,79,102,214,156,107,204,182,32,108,216,53,76,111,229,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
