Price\n\nLiberal religion journalist and New Testament scholar (once a Professor of NT at the University of Toronto, thus no slouch) has at last converted to the newly reascendant Christ Myth theory. The present book seems to be as much a report of his subjective reaction to the evidence as an exposition of the evidence itself. One occasionally gets the feeling that Harpur is offering his testimony, in the fashion of a revivalistic convert, as evidence for his belief. There is also perhaps a bit too much cataloguing of big names in support of the proposition that Jesus didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exist. What did the trick for Tom Harpur was his very late in the day reading of three scholars who are as far off the chart for most NT scholars as a historical Jesus was for the apostle Paul: Geoffrey Higgins, Gerald Massey, and Alvin Boyd Kuhn (though he also quite properly draws attention to the erudite Earl Doherty). As a result, it is the similarity between the Jesus story and a number of Osiris and Horus mythemes that proves the mythic nature of Jesus for Harpur. But he hardly stops there. Harpur argues that the gospel writers were not only recycling already ancient myth-matter, but that they had no intention of claiming what they set down was historical fact. It was only the fascistic Church fathers of the third century who conspired to literalize the myth. Until then, he says, everyone (at least elites and initiates) understood the gospel story, like all other ancient incarnation and redeemer myths, to be allegories for the divine spark in every human breast and the resultant possibilities of human transformation. What leaden, iron-fisted Catholicism did was to restrict this divine humanity to Jesus alone, as if he were an actual living, breathing concrete individual, a Superman possessing remarkable powers that the mundane Jimmy Olsens and Lois Lanes around him lacked. But do we have to wait for the third century for that? As Helmut Koester showed long ago, one can already see Jesus sucking the spiritual air out of the room in the Gospel of John, where only he, and no longer you, is the light of the world.  \n\nHarpur blames the Church for leaving Christians with a Christ they cannot hope to follow but are commanded to follow, then condemned for not following. Psalm 22 plus Catch 22. Oh that someone might break the chains of the spiritual proletariat and give them some manner of religious experience! If only they would get wise to the possibility made known through Egyptian parallels to the Bible, namely Ã¢â‚¬Å“Christ in you,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a power source through which the believer can do all things! But what a straw Christ this is! Can it have escaped Harpur that all our Evangelicals, Pentecostals, Fundamentalists, and Holy Rollers are already avidly pursuing spiritual rebirth and moral transformation, and that they are doing it because they believe the very Spirit of God is burning within them? I agree with Harpur that these dear souls are pathetically superstitious in their biblical literalism and their Ã¢â‚¬Å“butcher shop religionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (as Harry Emerson Fosdick once called it). But to depict them, with all orthodox Christians, as empty religious zombies is just absurd. I cannot see what difference it is supposed to make whether one believes the life-revolutionizing power entered him as of his born-again conversion experience or, a la Oprah and New Thought, it was always there but latent until oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s climactic realization that it was there. In fact, what the heckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the difference? In the final analysis, one wonders whether HarpurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gripe with these people is that they believe a bloody atonement was necessary to make their conversions possible. So what? Does our distaste for a particular doctrine matter so much that the rest of us have to set these Ã¢â‚¬Å“ignoramusesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (uh, like Karl Barth?) straight?   \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0512981ee648a87d8442c4e95a6c86b255016469","amp;dn":"The+Pagan+Christ%3A+Is+Blind+Faith+Killing+Christianity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0512981ee648a87d8442c4e95a6c86b255016469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,18,152,30,230,72,168,125,132,66,196,233,90,108,134,178,85,1,100,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
