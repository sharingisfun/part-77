In an age when the malfeasance of international banking has alerted exploited populations the world over to the unsustainability of an economic system predicated on perpetual growth, it is time the left ended its melancholic accommodation with capitalism. \n\nIn the new capitalism of networked information technologies, our very ability to communicate is exploited, but revolution is still possible if we organize on the basis of our common and collective desires. Examining the experience of the Occupy movement, Dean argues that such spontaneity canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t develop into a revolution and it needs to constitute itself as a party. \n\nAn innovative work of pressing relevance, The Communist Horizon offers nothing less than a manifesto for a new collective politics.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07e4bf1b5ab756f145126c129f9f7f56d0dbe790","amp;dn":"The+Communist+Horizon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07e4bf1b5ab756f145126c129f9f7f56d0dbe790","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,228,191,27,90,183,86,241,69,18,108,18,159,159,127,86,208,219,231,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
