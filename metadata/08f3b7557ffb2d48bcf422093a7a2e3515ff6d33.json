Dungeonesse, made up of vocalist Jenn Wasner of Wye Oak and Jon Ehrens of Art Department, is one of them, though they take a more straightforward approach. Most of the songs wouldn't sound too out of place on a Mtume record or as a Teena Marie B-side. Totally on a Miguel album. The duo sticks mostly to a late-night, melancholy mood, adding plenty of atmospheric synth washes and reverb to the ballads and a healthy amount of skittering percussion and rubbery funk to the more uptempo tracks. Ehrens is a very skilled producer, creating tightly wound tracks that are in the R&amp;B tradition but also a little dubby. Even kind of spacy at times. Wasner proved in Wye Oak that she could sing the hell out of indie rock; she does the same here with alt-R&amp;B. Her deep and rich vocals are the focal point of the songs and she carries them with ease, imbuing the grooves with tons of real emotion and loads of non-showy power. She digs deep into the midtempo tracks like &quot;Nightlight&quot; and &quot;Anywhere You Are&quot; and really puts them across with no frills or wasted feeling. \n\n  She rides the more uptempo grooves with a light touch, and they are the most easy-to-digest moments on the record. &quot;This Could Be Home&quot; has all the bounce and sass of a Mariah Carey hit (and a fun rap interlude from TT the Artist) and the swaggering hip-hop-tough &quot;Cadillac&quot; is a real jam. Ehrens, too, shines on these tracks. The rubbery Tom Tom Club-style bottom on &quot;Shucks&quot; is brilliant and the low-budget freestyle synths matched with hip-house beats on &quot;Soon&quot; is too. While it is a bit of an outlier among the moodier songs, the upbeat and ferociously sunny &quot;Drive You Crazy&quot; is the finest moment on Dungeonesse. The insistent beats, jagged bass pops, and shiny synths meet Wasner's achingly sweet and light vocals in an explosion of dance-pop perfection. It may stand out as the &quot;single&quot; but it's not far ahead; the rest is just as entertaining, well-crafted, and assured. Wasner and Ehrens have made an album that honors their devotion to R&amp;B and dance music in the best way possible, with love, respect, and a bunch of memorable jams.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08f3b7557ffb2d48bcf422093a7a2e3515ff6d33","amp;dn":"Dungeonesse+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D+PERFECT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08f3b7557ffb2d48bcf422093a7a2e3515ff6d33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,243,183,85,127,251,45,72,188,244,34,9,58,122,46,53,21,255,109,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
