May you feel\nconfused if a grp does not release that much most others\ndo. Especially if it's has serveed a couple of sections\nlike we did in the past. But now we want to satisfy our needs\nby figuring the folliwing out clearly\nWe did not steal this group name\nSure we did not do much since 2005, but we are going to kick\nstart our group again. So thats is not a valid reason to ban\nus from releasing\n\nThanks a lot for appreciation\n\nTeam DEFA\n\nAnd we're also saying thanks to a good new friend who made this happen\n\nSo finally.. just enjoy it\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d55bfb261ecbe6cb5b92d2114bf27f1470992f7","amp;dn":"Toxic.Bunny.HD-DEFA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d55bfb261ecbe6cb5b92d2114bf27f1470992f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,85,191,178,97,236,190,108,181,185,45,33,20,191,39,241,71,9,146,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
