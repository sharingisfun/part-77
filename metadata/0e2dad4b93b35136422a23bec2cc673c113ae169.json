A young ninja in a fantastic land of dreams and nightmares must face an army of zombies to save a beautiful sorceress.\n\nIn the fog-enshrouded peaks of the island nation of Nehan, Ran, a newly-minted shadow warrior is set loose on a musha shugyo, a wandering quest, whereby he must travel alone and hone his skills. Journeying aboard a merchant vessel, Ran hears tales of a mysterious lord believed to have the dead for his servants. \n\nSoon these tales prove all too real as Ran comes to the aid of Jysal, a beautiful sorceress, whose undeveloped power gives her the ability to heal a land -- or destroy it. But the Lord Kan-Gul also covets Jysal's power. And when Kan-Gul sends a army of the undead to take Jysal by force, Ran is faced with the ultimate warrior's choice: save himself, or face down a horde of enemies that cannot be killed for the simple reason that they are already dead!\n\nBook 1 in a new series, the Shadow Warrior saga.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e2dad4b93b35136422a23bec2cc673c113ae169","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Scrolls+of+Fudo+Shin+%28FO%29+%28azw3%2Cpdf%2Crtf%2Cepub%2Clit%2Clrf%2Cmo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e2dad4b93b35136422a23bec2cc673c113ae169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,45,173,75,147,179,81,54,66,42,35,190,194,204,103,60,17,58,225,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
