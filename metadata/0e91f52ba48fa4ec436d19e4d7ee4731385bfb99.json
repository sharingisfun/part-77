My name's Casey Kasem and I'm all set to countdown the biggest hits in the USA.&quot;\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nStevie Wonder is well represented in this countdown. He has a song at number 10, a duet with Paul McCartney at number 21, and a &quot;Stars On 45&quot; tribute at number 38.\n\nBob and Doug McKenzie have a song at number 37 with a guest appearance by Canadian RUSH front-man Geddy Lee.\n\nTwo listeners ask the same question, &quot;In chart history, what song  has spent the most weeks at number one?&quot; Casey says it's a three way tie between big band songs.  \n\nCasey discusses number one songs based on fads; one about running naked in public, one about the CB radio, and one about the martial arts.\n\nVangelis won an Oscar for his score to &quot;Chariots Of Fire&quot;.
