At the beginning of the war in Bosnia, his life in his little village with his best friend Halil (Nikola PejakoviÃ„â€¡), a Bosniak, is generally quiet and reminiscent of that of a normal lifestyle in the countryside. He gradually notices that Bosniaks whom he knew in his village are slowly but surely moving out.\n\nDuring the conflict, Milan joins the Bosnian Serb Army and is attached to a squad that includes:\n\n    Velja (Nikola Kojo): A career criminal and thief from Belgrade who did most of his &quot;work&quot; in Germany in the late 1980s and early 1990s. On a visit home, he pretended to be his younger brother, knowing full well he'd be taken to the frontlines, when authorities came to pick up his draft-dodging sibling. He provides the film's title. After the squad set a village alight, they watch it burn and he says: &quot;Pretty villages are pretty when they burn. Ugly villages stay ugly, even when they burn.&quot; (in Serbian, Lepa sela lepo gore, a ruÃ…Â¾na sela ostaju ruÃ…Â¾na, Ã„ï¿½ak i kad gore.)\n\n\n\nDirected by \tSrÃ„â€˜an DragojeviÃ„â€¡\nProduced by \tDragan BjelogrliÃ„â€¡\nGoran BjelogrliÃ„â€¡\nMilko Josifov\nNikola Kojo\nWritten by \tVanja BuliÃ„â€¡\nSrÃ„â€˜an DragojeviÃ„â€¡\nBiljana MaksiÃ„â€¡\nNikola PejakoviÃ„â€¡\nStarring \tDragan BjelogrliÃ„â€¡\nNikola Kojo\nMilorad MandiÃ„â€¡\nDragan MaksimoviÃ„â€¡\nMusic by \tAleksandar HabiÃ„â€¡\nLaza Ristovski\nCinematography \tDuÃ…Â¡an JoksimoviÃ„â€¡\nEditing by \tPetar MarkoviÃ„â€¡\nStudio \tRTS\nMinistry of Culture\nCobra Films\nRelease date(s) \tMay 1996\nRunning time \t115 minutes\nCountry \tFR Yugoslavia\nLanguage \tSerbian\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f904edf7ae988c1f0f164ec5c3cfceef53c3a52","amp;dn":"Pretty+Village%2C+Pretty+Flame+%281996%29+DVD9+PAL+ENG+SUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f904edf7ae988c1f0f164ec5c3cfceef53c3a52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,144,78,223,122,233,136,193,240,241,100,236,92,60,252,238,245,60,58,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
