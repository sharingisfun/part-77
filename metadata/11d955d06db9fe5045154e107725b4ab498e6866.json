No one is safe. Then they hijack a bus and the party continues on the freeway, sort of like Magical Mystery Tour for hopheads and perverts. Very sleazy, released in the famous Summer of '69. \n\nThere is a moralizing narrator and suspenseful library music.\n\nTrailer also included.\n\nNot a good movie, but it's a collector's item.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11d955d06db9fe5045154e107725b4ab498e6866","amp;dn":"She+Came+On+The+Bus+%281969-SWV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11d955d06db9fe5045154e107725b4ab498e6866","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,217,85,208,109,185,254,80,69,21,78,16,119,37,180,171,73,142,104,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
