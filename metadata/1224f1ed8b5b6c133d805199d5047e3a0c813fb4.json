They arrived late and to be honest I could not ask them to close the - already long - row. So I had the reshuffle the row a bit, to reassign a more logical place. No one expects to find Simon &amp; Garfunkel at the bottom.\n\nA lot of work. However, music is a living thing and so some of the other portraits had already undergone some make over. And ordered in five more or less matching rows, it all makes more sense now. So its not too bad to download it again.\n\nAt the other hand, you cannot keep maintaining things for ever. Sometimes its time for something new. So this must be really it. A kind of sketch of old and new Pop Music in 75 Portraits (about 10% I portrayed). All in the best MP3 (unfortunately?) tracks I could find and all ordered (so you can play it as a real Playlist).\n\nDon't be angry if your favorite Band or Song is missing (You are free to add and delete if you wish. If I could, I would have done that already.). I just tried to relive all performed songs as if I would play and sing it myself.\n\nThe songs in which I could radiate the most energy and I was quite sure the original artists would like to be portrayed (Sound), I selected. And ordered the songs like a personal concert, valid for as many people as possible.\n\nI hope the Artists and You can appreciate it.... Enjoy (and listen to these girls and boys; they really have something to say)\n\nPS: I still looking for the two last candidates for my Exceptional Misfits series. Three I have already: Mike Old Field, N.E.R.D. and Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson. Suggestions?
