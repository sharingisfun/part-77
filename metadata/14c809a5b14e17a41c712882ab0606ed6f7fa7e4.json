I downloaded these off of Youtube and decided that even though someone could download them off of Youtube the same way I did, it'd be nice to be able to use a torrent.\n\n-Stats-\n\nResolution: 1280x720\nFile Type: MP4\nFrame Rate: 23 fps\nAudio Bit-rate: 192kbps\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44 kHz\n\n\nThe file sizes are about 3.5 GB each, and each movie is pretty long:\n\nAssassin's Creed 1 - 3:01:29\nAssassin's Creed 2 - 3:09:03\nAssassin's Creed Brotherhood - 2:47:08\nAssassin's Creed Revelations - 3:06:29\nAssassin's Creed 3 - 4:11:49\n\nThere are some audio issues in these, they tend to go from very loud to very quiet. I use Media Player Classic and I can normalize the audio but there's still some issues.\n\nThere's also some trouble where I can tell the original recorder was lagging during cutscenes. The good thing is that it isn't very bad and doesn't happen that often, but it's still very obvious.\n\nAnd finally, though they did manage to get rid of almost the entire GUI for their recording, unfortunately some hints and such pop up at random times and are VERY noticeable.\n\nDespite all this, these are very good movie adaptions of the games. They cut out a lot of the side stories but keep enough of it there that you can relive the entire experience without playing through hours upon hours of each game.\n\n\nKeep in mind this is my first torrent, so I'm not sure if I put all the necessary information, but I tried. I'll seed this whenever my computer's on, which should be every day from at least 3 PM to midnight in Eastern Standard Time. I'll probably stop once this gets at least 50 seeders or so, so that I can seed other torrents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14c809a5b14e17a41c712882ab0606ed6f7fa7e4","amp;dn":"Youtube+Rip+-+Assassin%27s+Creed+in+Movie+Form+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14c809a5b14e17a41c712882ab0606ed6f7fa7e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,200,9,165,177,78,23,164,28,113,40,130,171,6,6,237,111,127,167,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
