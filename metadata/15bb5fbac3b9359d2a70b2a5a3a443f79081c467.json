By combining the discipline of literary criticism with the hermeneutics of feminism, she reinterprets the tragic stories of four women in ancient Israel: Hagar, Tamar, an unnamed concubine, and the daughter of Jephthah. In highlighting the silence, absence, and oppostition of God, as well as human cruelty, Trible shows how these neglected stories-interpreted in memoriam-challenge both the misogyny of Scripture and its use in church, synagogue, and academy.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15bb5fbac3b9359d2a70b2a5a3a443f79081c467","amp;dn":"Texts+of+Terror%3A+Literary-Feminist+Readings+of+Biblical+Narrativ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15bb5fbac3b9359d2a70b2a5a3a443f79081c467","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,187,95,186,195,185,53,157,42,112,178,165,163,164,67,247,144,129,196,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
