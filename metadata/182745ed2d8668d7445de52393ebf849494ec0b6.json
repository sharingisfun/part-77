Episodes 12 and 13 are there but not 11.\n\nI haven't watched this yet so I can't comment on the quality, I only checked the first 5 seconds to make sure that it is actually episode 11 and it appears that it is genuine.\n\n\nThe specs are the same as all the other QRUS releases:\n\nVideo:\n1280 x 720\n23.976 fps\n36:15 runtime\n\nAudio:\nEnglish 5.1 AC3\n48 Khz \n640 Kbs\n\nLet me know if the file is good, I would watch it myself but I haven't even started watching the first Ep yet, I'm waiting for all the QRUS files, only 2 to go.\n\nThanks to the QRUS team for making good quality encodes and please seed this as much as you can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:182745ed2d8668d7445de52393ebf849494ec0b6","amp;dn":"Arrested.Development.S04E11.720p.WEBRip.x264-QRUS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"182745ed2d8668d7445de52393ebf849494ec0b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,39,69,237,45,134,104,215,68,93,229,35,147,235,248,73,73,78,192,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
