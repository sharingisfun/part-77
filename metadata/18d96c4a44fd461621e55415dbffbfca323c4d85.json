While it is said that everyone has a double, O'Brien believes an entire family having a mirror image is beyond coincidence, especially when the family he knew existed nearly fifty years ago. Follow Tom O'Brien in his quest for answers and his mission to ensure his life is not destroyed by a time dimensional warp. Live with a modern day rancher and his family as they travel to the 1960's to spend fifteen years in the past, making friends and riding herd through two lifetimes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18d96c4a44fd461621e55415dbffbfca323c4d85","amp;dn":"Twice+Upon+a+Time+by+C.+C.+Phillips","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18d96c4a44fd461621e55415dbffbfca323c4d85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,217,108,74,68,253,70,22,33,229,84,21,219,255,191,202,50,60,77,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
