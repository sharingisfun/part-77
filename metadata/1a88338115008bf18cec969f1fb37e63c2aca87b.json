Convenience Pack 2)\nINSTALL $ BOOT CD\nJAPANESE\n------------------------------\n\nOS/2 is a computer operating system, initially created by Microsoft and IBM, then later developed by IBM exclusively. The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a88338115008bf18cec969f1fb37e63c2aca87b","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+4.52+-+14.089+-+Japanese+-+CDROM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a88338115008bf18cec969f1fb37e63c2aca87b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,136,51,129,21,0,139,241,140,236,150,159,31,179,126,99,194,172,168,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
