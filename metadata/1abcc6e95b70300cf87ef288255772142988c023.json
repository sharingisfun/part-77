Needing a balance of $45,000 in 90 days, he travels to Denver, poses as a Swiss shoeclerk, seduces a German housemaid, and robs her wealthy employer. Moving on to Boston, he hires an electronics expert for the planned bank robbery and, while posing as a termite exterminator and would-be writer, gains entry into the home of prominent Mrs. Galbrace. Eli quickly woos and weds the lady's beautiful secretary, Inger, and sends her to Los Angeles to set up their home, explaining he will follow by truck. Instead, he robs still another rich woman, Margaret Kirby, and then gets a flight to Los Angeles on a chartered plane by posing as a delegate to a Knights of Columbus convention. After paying for the bank blueprints with the proceeds from his robberies, Eli enlists two men, Eddie Hart and Paul Feng, to aid him in the heist. Even the unknowing Inger assists by taking pictures of the bank for a magazine article she believes Eli is writing. The robbery is timed to coincide with the arrival of the Russian premier, and Eli goes to the airport dressed as an Australian police inspector taking a handcuffed extradited prisoner (Eddie Hart) out of the country. Eli even gets the police to help him and his prisoner board a plane bound for Mexico. As he makes a successful getaway with the bank money and contemplates his next identity, he is totally unaware that Inger has been frantically trying to find him--she has inherited $7 million from her former employer, Mrs. Galbrace.\n\nInfo:\n\nFile Size           : 1,38 GB\nPlay Time           : 1h 47 min\nVideo Count         : 1\nAudio Count         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideo Codec         : XVID\nCodec               : DivX 5\nCodec/Family        : MPEG-4\nVideo Width         : 720 piexs\nVideo Height        : 400 piexs\nVideo Frame Rate    : 23.976 fps\nVideo Stream        : 1718 kbps\nVideo BitRate       : 1835 kbps\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudio Codec         : MP3\nAudio BitRate       : 128 kbps\nAudio Channels      : 2\nAudio SampleRate    : 48 KHz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1abcc6e95b70300cf87ef288255772142988c023","amp;dn":"Dead+Heat+on+a+Merry-Go-Round+%281966%29+DVDrip-XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1abcc6e95b70300cf87ef288255772142988c023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,188,198,233,91,112,48,12,248,126,242,136,37,87,114,20,41,136,192,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
