With such an effective technique, Fong naturally gains an unnerving reputation throughout China. The killer is beginning to rethink the actions of his life though and sees the next few jobs as definitely being his last. After his girlfriend commits suicide he finds his priorities in life changing even though his employers promise him rich rewards for obedience. Fong agrees to take one final assignment; to kill a man named Lai in a specified town. The obvious catch is that the town is inhabited by scores of men with this name and therefore the assassin must carefully search out his target. While staying in the designated location, Fong befriends a local boy who proves to be a mischievous, yet good-hearted youngster who is merely looking for a father figure. Over time, the supreme fighter agrees to teach the boy kung-fu so that he can defend himself and the rest of his family. As the master-student bond develops, so does the friendship between Fong and the youngster's mother and grandfather. Fully immersed in this ordinary life, the killer forgets his assignment, but is quickly reminded of it when he discovers who Lai really is. Now Minute Fong must decide whether his loyalty lies with his new friends or his ruthless employers.\n\nGeneral Info\n\nCompression: No\nMovie Quality: DVD5\nAudio Languages:Ita Dolby Digital Dual-Mono 2.0\nColors\nArea:Pal Area 2 (Europe/Japan)\nDuration:88 min.\nScreen Format:PAL 4/3 Letterbox\nExtra:Yes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d3692bdd107c6fdf645b8a338540344483a0a4f","amp;dn":"My+Life%27s+on+the+Line+-+Gli+Eroi+Del+Kung+Fu+1979+%28DVD5%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d3692bdd107c6fdf645b8a338540344483a0a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,54,146,189,209,7,198,253,246,69,184,163,56,84,3,68,72,58,10,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
