The deeper he sinks into his twisted psychosis, the more he starts to believe that he is in fact a superhero.\n\nWhen he meets Grace, she quickly becomes the love of his life, forcing Michael to walk a tightrope. He finds himself struggling between his vengeful persona and his need to leave behind the personal war that he has waged. Driven by his madness, he is consumed in a situation that is beyond his control. Before he knows it, Michael is sucked into an undertow of corruption with no means of escape.
