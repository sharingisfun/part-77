First time I've ever attempted to start a torrent on my own.\n\nNobody should really have any interest in this but me as its an older version of Mac OS X without many adjustments, I just don't want to restart and redo the research to Linux/BSD-ify it as much as possible. Also iCloud might have a bunch of pictures of my pet Squirrel. He has a Facebook page if you really really want to see him.\n\nI guess I'll find out fairly soon if I can delete a torrent after I've started it... Here goes nothing. =)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e5b3de43cdae7037dfb9ac0e4c163929fd52102","amp;dn":"Personal+MACOS+VMWare+image%2C+not+much+progress+yet.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e5b3de43cdae7037dfb9ac0e4c163929fd52102","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,91,61,228,60,218,231,3,125,251,154,192,228,193,99,146,159,213,33,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
