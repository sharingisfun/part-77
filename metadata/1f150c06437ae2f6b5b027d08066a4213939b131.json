In what is widely regarded as Shakespeare's greatest creative achievement, a story of family conflict ultimately reveals the bare futility of the human condition.\n\nDirector Jonathan Miller has had so many triumphs with this great Shakespearian tragedy that his name is now synonymous with the play. In this renowned version, the Royal Shakespeare Company's Michael Hordern gives a remarkable performance in the lead role.\n\n\nFor more information, you can visit:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Television_Shakespeare#King_Lear&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Television_Shakespeare#King_Lear&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leninimports.com/king_lear_dvd.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leninimports.com/king_lear_dvd.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nProduced by Shaun Sutton\nDirected by Jonathan Miller\nTaping dates: 26 March-2 April 1982\nOriginally transmitted in the UK: 19 September 1982\n\nJohn Shrapnel  as  Kent\nNorman Rodway  as  Gloucester\nMichael Kitchen  as  Edmund\nMichael Hordern  as  King Lear\nGillian Barge  as  Goneril\nBrenda Blethyn  as  Cordelia\nPenelope Wilton  as  Regan\nJohn Bird  as  Albany\nJulian Curry  as  Cornwall\nDavid Weston  as  Burgundy\nHarry Waters  as  The King of France\nAnton Lesser  as  Edgar\nJohn Grillo  as  Oswald\nFrank Middlemass  as  Fool\nKen Stott  as  Curan\nGeorge Howe  as  Doctor\n\nRunning Time: 184'28&quot;\n\n\nimages\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://i.imgur.com/UnUV7bD.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://i.imgur.com/UnUV7bD.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sJtLH2E.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sJtLH2E.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSeed, please!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f150c06437ae2f6b5b027d08066a4213939b131","amp;dn":"King+Lear+%281982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f150c06437ae2f6b5b027d08066a4213939b131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,21,12,6,67,122,226,246,181,176,39,208,128,102,164,33,57,57,177,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
