Elisa is the chosen one. \nBut she is also the younger of two princesses, the one who has never done anything remarkable. She canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see how she ever will. Now, on her sixteenth birthday, she has become the secret wife of a handsome and worldly kingÃ¢â‚¬â€a king whose country is in turmoil. A king who needs the chosen one, not a failure of a princess. \nAnd heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the only one who needs her. Savage enemies seething with dark magic are hunting her. A daring, determined revolutionary thinks she could be his peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s savior. And he looks at her in a way that no man has ever looked at her before. Soon it is not just her life, but her very heart that is at stake. \nElisa could be everything to those who need her most. If the prophecy is fulfilled. If she finds the power deep within herself. If she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t die young. \nMost of the chosen do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fe3b8d8eba952975e6f2d927251400059d854ca","amp;dn":"The+Girl+of+Fire+and+Thorns+-+Rae+Carson.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fe3b8d8eba952975e6f2d927251400059d854ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,227,184,216,235,169,82,151,94,111,45,146,114,81,64,0,89,216,84,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
