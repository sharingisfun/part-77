It seems to be that might be interesting in a film about war games in the genre of action film. &quot;In the area of Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹special attention&quot; is not the classic thriller, which is always something explodes, shooting everywhere, and the main character alone of all the wins. But in spite of this movie is interesting. Watched it many times, but never bored.\n\n  The film was created to bring in the army to more people, and he succeeded. Very good story does not get bored. This is not war, it's teachings. But the soldiers are doing their duty, enduring all the hardships and privations. Very emotional ending of the film turned out with shots landing mass and the moment of separation from the aircraft, which, despite the film certainly remember each jumper.\n\n  The film deserves the highest rating.\n\n\nWithout exaggeration I can say that this is my favorite Soviet fighter. I watched it many times and will continue to revise it. And despite the fact that there are no explosions, car chases, shooting at each step, specific to each fighter, he is no worse than other representatives of the genre.\n\n  This bet is placed on the subject, and he is very curious. It's interesting to see the screen a large war game. Moreover, the game entertaining and exciting. Just admire the work of the writers. The events in the film are developing rapidly and unpredictably, there is no fit.\n\n  Even today, this film breathes freshness and novelty, and it's been over 30 years since its release. Great acting. No one falls out of his role. You look and you believe that this is the real soldiers.\n\n\nThe film though is not long (one and a half hours by modern standards - not the timing), but captures from the first frame. An alarm is raised Parachute Regiment (the film was made on the basis of the Kaunas Airborne Division) - began teaching, and dropping to the main landing forces, three reconnaissance to find a masked enemy command post. Yes it's not war, just a game of war - but the team has solved all the tricks, so the game will be tough!\n\n The film is without a doubt would be expensive to someone who served in the Airborne Troops. It shows exactly what defines a service in the airborne infantry - combat anxiety, hours-long marches, the hardships of everyday life martial, an unforgettable moment of separation from the aircraft. It shows the real officers such as Lieutenant Tarasov, and the real soldiers - ordinary Egorov and Pugachev. And from the first to the last minute of the picture makes us believe that - &quot;In any place, any time, any task.&quot;\n\n And I firmly believe that this film have a special place in the heart of every boy who once dreamed to wear vest and blue beret - no matter how old this boy now.\n\n\n\nEgorov ran sings a song from the animated film &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;. In real life, when running (especially when forced marches) can not sing. You can not even speak - from singing or talking lost his breath.\n\n  Airborne Reconnaissance not wear blue berets on the job. They wear camouflage hats and masks, but the General Margelov personally demanded that had blue berets.\n\nThe film does not have the aircraft markings. In the Soviet Army used IL-76 Aeroflot, because that could fly abroad on commercial flights, but still could not show that Aeroflot - military organization. And so the aircraft repainted by hand in each frame.\n\nThe film was cut a lot of things (including documentaries), due to security reasons. Unfortunately, all of this material was destroyed in the process of installation. Therefore, the director's version never will be.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:216279943cbcfbe87412ad45027a49d278395c58","amp;dn":"Auf+dem+Platz+Aufmerksamkeit__In+the+square+attention","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"216279943cbcfbe87412ad45027a49d278395c58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,98,121,148,60,188,251,232,116,18,173,69,2,122,73,210,120,57,92,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
