SkinnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surprising and engaging, erudite and witty account will enthrall fans of WinchesterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Professor and the Madman and The Meaning of Everything, and The Know-It-All by A.J. Jacobs, as it explores a culture in transition and the brilliant, colorful individuals behind it. The Story of AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t is a smart, often outrageous, and altogether remarkable tale of how egos, infighting, and controversy shaped one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most authoritative language texts, sparking a furious language debate that the late, great author David Foster Wallace (Infinite Jest) once called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Fort Sumter of the Usage Wars.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21e59826f9f32e2aa49aa464fbc253706a166ed2","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+Ain%27t%3A+America%2C+Its+Language%2C+and+the+Most+Controve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21e59826f9f32e2aa49aa464fbc253706a166ed2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,229,152,38,249,243,46,42,164,154,164,100,251,194,83,112,106,22,110,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
