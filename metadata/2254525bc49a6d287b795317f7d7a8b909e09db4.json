For their Speed Bump challenge, they have to rework their dishes to get rid of all starches on their menus. On day two, they're given their Truck Stop challenge: they have to dig up the potatoes they need at a nearby farm, and they'll need a lot, as the potatoes must be the main ingredient in all menu items. After reaching their sales goal, they race to a vista high above the city, where the first three teams to arrive win a reward, and the team who sold the least over the weekend is eliminated.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 01-Sep-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2254525bc49a6d287b795317f7d7a8b909e09db4","amp;dn":"The.Great.Food.Truck.Race.S04E03.WS.DSR.x264-NY2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2254525bc49a6d287b795317f7d7a8b909e09db4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,84,82,91,196,154,109,40,123,121,83,23,247,215,168,185,9,224,157,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
