Three years after his debut album &quot;Premiering In Theaters&quot;, Tempo Giusto keeps composing against the mainstream and takes his unique sound on a deeper level with his second full album of different trance works. From The Core. From the soul. From within the deepest dimensions of creation, Tempo Giusto imparts visions from his musical multiverse ranging from joyous brightness of Cabo Rico to primal darkness of Blacksmith. In addition to the four pre-released album singles, the album contains seven unreleased original works and three collaborations, all with amazing different personalities and musical organisms. A page could easily be written about each track and its nuances but From The Core is best enjoyed as it's served - loud through loudspeakers. From The Core is unquestionably one of the most interesting trance albums released in 2013, already raising Tempo Giusto high on the charts again.\n\n             &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.beatport.com/release/from-the-core/1145795&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.beatport.com/release/from-the-core/1145795&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
