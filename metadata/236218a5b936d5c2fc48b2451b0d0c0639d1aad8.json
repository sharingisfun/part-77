We'll continue to boil down the reasons why the West needs Assad out of power, and poke holes through Kerry's comments that an attack would be &quot;unbelievably small.&quot; \n\nAlex also breaks down the latest news on the Sen. Graham's warning of a nuke attack on South Carolina and new developments in the secret Dyess Air Force base weapons transfer. \n\nOn today's show, Alex welcomes the founder and host of Freedomain Radio, Stefan Molyneux, to discuss the global awakening to tyranny rapidly taking place in large thanks to independent and alternative media sources.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
