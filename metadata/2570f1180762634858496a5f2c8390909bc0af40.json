You can tell Bruce is getting impatient at the beginning of track 10 of 'Samson' as he begins yelling at someone on the side of the stage to get Bobby on the stage since his set is about to end.  It's a little humorous, but you can tell he's a little pissed and throwing the F word around a bit. \n\nI have NO idea why Bruce played 'Samson' at the beginning of the show and ended up playing it again with Weir at the end of the show.\n\n\n\n--- FFP INFO ---\n01.
