The original transmission was a watershed moment in Irish TV history, leading to an outcry and national debate about domestic violence.\n\nFamily centres on the Spencers, a family living in a Dublin housing project. Charlo, played by SeÃƒÂ¡n McGinley, is the abusive and cheating husband of Paula, played by Ger Ryan. They have four children: teenagers John Paul and Nicola, and younger children Leanne and Jack. \nTold over four episodes, each one devoted to a different family member, this series gives an often harrowing picture of Irish working class life in the 1990s. The first episode focuses on Charlo; the abusive, alcoholic father and husband who makes his living as a small-time crook. Episode two takes up the story of rebellious teenager, John Paul, just as heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s starting secondary school.\n\nThe third instalment tells the story from the perspective of Nicola, who works in a clothing factory and has a particularly strained relationship with her father. In the fourth and final part we meet the emotionally and physically battered matriarch, Paula, who reclaims her identity by throwing Charlo out of the house and getting a job.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25721f08b0e3b6d1a0873e4cc9b46f6393478aea","amp;dn":"Family+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25721f08b0e3b6d1a0873e4cc9b46f6393478aea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,114,31,8,176,227,182,209,160,135,62,76,201,180,111,99,147,71,138,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
