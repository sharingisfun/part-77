Brad, however, has other business ideas, and uses the downtime on the cruise to set up a Shed pulled pork sandwich concession with Hobson, right there on the beach. While Brooke and crew catch fish (and have a close encounter with a shark), Brad races back and forth to The Shed on his speed boat when he runs out of sandwiches to sell. Back on land, Big Hoss is recruited by his daughter's summer day camp to give a demonstration on barbecue, and the gentle giant in turn recruits Hazel to come and help him out.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 19-Aug-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:268c4e6641249bebfb32de61ab503c523d290082","amp;dn":"The.Shed.S01E04.HDTV.x264-OMiCRON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"268c4e6641249bebfb32de61ab503c523d290082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,140,78,102,65,36,155,235,251,50,222,97,171,80,60,82,61,41,0,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
