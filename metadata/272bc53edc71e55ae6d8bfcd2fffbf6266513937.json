Legend has it that, unlike Black Sabbath, Zior were serious practitioners of the black arts - for all the good it did their career.\n\nVocalist Keith Bonsor is ex-ESSEX FIVE and CARDBOARD ORCHESTRA.  Peter Brewer had been a member of THE NIGHTRIDERS.  Bassist Barry Skeels had once been a member of THE BUMS.\n\nZIOR's debut 1971 album, issued on the Nepentha label, drew comparisons to higher profile heavy metal bands, not just the music but also the album cover, which was designed by the same artist (Keef) who had shot the first BLACK SABBATH album.\n\nZIOR switched to Intercord for the Germany-only release of their next LP &quot;Every Inch A Man&quot; on the Global imprint.  This album featured an intro of pseudo-occult ramblings, and the track 'Entrance Of The Devil' (included here as a bonus) replete with maniacal laughter and terrified screams.\n\nThe members of ZIOR released a black magic flavoured hard rock album under pseudonyms as MONUMENT on the Beacon Label in 1971.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:272bc53edc71e55ae6d8bfcd2fffbf6266513937","amp;dn":"Zior+-+Zior+%281971%29%28hard+rock%2C+heavy+metal%2C+blues%29%28mp3%29%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"272bc53edc71e55ae6d8bfcd2fffbf6266513937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,43,197,62,220,113,229,90,230,216,191,205,47,255,191,98,102,81,57,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
