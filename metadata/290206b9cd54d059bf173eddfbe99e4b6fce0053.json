Finding himself embroiled in a vast international conspiracy, Jung must determine the North's role in the deal, as well as the potential involvement of the CIA, Israel's Mossad, international terrorist organizations, and any other covert operatives lurking in Berlin's polyglot underworld.\n\nConfronting the possibility of a double agent within Berlin's North Korean embassy where his wife Ryeon Jung-hee (Jeon Ji-hyun) is a translator, Pyo discovers that Pyongyang security authorities have dispatched ruthless fixer Dong Myung-soo (Ryu Seung-beom) to sort out potentially conflicting loyalties at the consulate. Dong's investigation quickly implicates Ryeon and he gives Pyo just 48 hours to incriminate his wife, who is suspected of leaking information on the arms deal to South Korean agents trying to gain access to a secret multi-billion dollar bank account controlled by Pyongyang authorities.\n\nDespite an apparently loveless marriage, Pyo is reluctant to betray Ryeon, particularly after she discloses she's pregnant. He senses that she was set up by Dong and his father to gain favor with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. But when the North Korean ambassador makes an attempt to defect to the West, Pyo becomes incriminated as well. Narrowly escaping an assassination squad dispatched by Dong, Ryeon and Pyo go on the run, with the rival Korean intelligence agencies closing in fast.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:290206b9cd54d059bf173eddfbe99e4b6fce0053","amp;dn":"The+Berlin+File+XVID.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"290206b9cd54d059bf173eddfbe99e4b6fce0053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,2,6,185,205,84,208,89,191,23,62,221,251,233,158,75,111,206,0,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
