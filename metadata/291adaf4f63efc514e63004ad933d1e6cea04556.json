This time is the early eighties. The characters go to the same schools and eat at the same restaurants. Their voices enfold us as seamlessly as those of DJs heard over a car radio. They have sex with the same boys and girls and buy from the same dealers. In short, they are connected in the only way people can be in that city.\n\n \n\nDirk sees his best friend killed in a desert car wreck, then rifles through his pockets for a last joint before the ambulance comes. Cheryl, a wannabe newscaster, chides her future stepdaughter, Ã¢â‚¬Å“You're tan but you don't look happy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jamie is a clubland carnivore with a taste for human blood. As rendered by Ellis, their interactions compose a chilling, fascinating, and outrageous descent into the abyss beneath L.A.'s gorgeous surfaces.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:291adaf4f63efc514e63004ad933d1e6cea04556","amp;dn":"The+Informers+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"291adaf4f63efc514e63004ad933d1e6cea04556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,26,218,244,246,62,252,81,78,99,0,74,217,51,209,230,206,160,69,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
