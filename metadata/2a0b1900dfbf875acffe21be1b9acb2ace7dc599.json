It uploads it, but then it basically just shows a blank page with the BAYIMG info at the top, but no image info.  I've tried it in Firefox and Google Chrome, and nothing.  \n==============================================================\n\nThis is my collection of short stories &amp; flash fiction that I self published a few years back.  I've tried a few times to post it here before but I just am not good with the whole creating torrents thing.  I got it down now, so hopefully this works.\n\nThrough The Soul's Window is a collection of 12 short stories dealing with people whose actions are driven by their emotions and how they react to them. Some react well, others do not. Some end happily, others do not.\n\nWhether we like to admit it or not, we all tend to be driven by emotions, try as we might to avoid it.\n\nDETAILS: 12 Stories / 40 Pages / 16,336 words\n\nContains some adult themes and mild adult language","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a0b1900dfbf875acffe21be1b9acb2ace7dc599","amp;dn":"Through+The+Soul%27s+Window+%28My+Collection+of+Short+Fiction%29+EPUB%2F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a0b1900dfbf875acffe21be1b9acb2ace7dc599","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,11,25,0,223,191,135,90,207,254,33,190,27,154,203,42,206,125,197,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
