For the software to do its job properly you have to place the disks installed on your computer into Shadow Mode. By doing this, the application will take a snapshot of the disk and run every file in virtual mode. You will have the same access to the files on the disk but any write action will be virtual. This means that no matter how many worms and spywares you infect your computer with, they will not affect the real system at all because of the virtualization. Once you snap out of this &quot;parallel dimension&quot; every change to the system and the files on the disk will be discarded.\t\n\nThe conclusion in this sense is that the computer will not be affected by any change and no malicious files will be written to the PC. The greatest thing is that you can choose what can actually get stuck on the disk while in Shadow Mode. More than this, you can decide in advance what files and folders should not benefit from Shadow Mode protection.\n\nFeatures\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Prevent any unknown and future virus.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Eliminate the system downtime and PC maintenance cost.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Surf the internet safely.\n\nVersion 1.3.0.457 - September 13, 2013\nWhat's New: Supports Windows 8.1.\nWhat's Fixed: A GUI bug related to Registry Exclusion List.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a3e975f037ec6de8f8692ef42d78a6f3a54be34","amp;dn":"Shadow+Defender+1.3.0.457+Final+Incl+KeyGen+By+Ak0DLL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a3e975f037ec6de8f8692ef42d78a6f3a54be34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,62,151,95,3,126,198,222,143,134,146,239,66,215,138,111,58,84,190,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
