Instead of focusing on important tasks, you might waste your time organizing your desktop icons, to make them easier to find. Desk 365 can be used to sort shortcuts on separate pages, but its functionality is more advanced than it sounds. The application works like a second Start menu, which is much more elegant. \n\nDesk 365 is distributed as a freeware application. Its setup file is roughly 4 MB and you can install it in a few seconds, without setting up additional tools and services or rebooting your computer. The application works on all modern Windows platforms, without any significant impact on the computer's performance. \n\nYou will definitely appreciate Desk 365 for its simplicity and its sleek design. Ad previously stated, the application works like a second Start menu. It places a new button on the task bar, next to the Start button, that reveals a transparent panel, on which you can organize your shortcuts. You can switch between different pages, on the same panel, by clicking a series of navigation buttons, located in the lower region of the panel. A few commonly used shortcuts for web browsers, Windows Explorer and others are placed by default beneath the navigation buttons. They are displayed at all times, regardless of which page you access. You can also find Shutdown options, a resource usage meter and an Accelerate option. \n\nThere are multiple ways of adding new shortcuts on Desk 365's panel. The most direct approach is to drag and drop files or shortcuts on the panel. If you have shortcuts on your desktop, the application can move them on the panel right away. Alternatively, you may click an Add icon, which can be found on every page. This will extend the interface, on the right side, to reveal a series of shortcuts for commonly used applications, social mediaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and more. You just need to click an icon in order to send it to the selected page. You can send it back at any time, by clicking a Remove icon, located on the shortcut itself. While the panel is extended, you can also bring up a standard Open dialog, to place a shortcut for any file on your hard drive. \n\nAnother neat feature is the possibility of displaying the Start menu's contents on Desk 365's panel, on the left side. You can navigate through the contents just like in the original Start menu, click shortcuts to launch applications or click their Add icons to add them on the application's interface. It is worth mentioning that the interface has a modern and sleek design. By default, the shortcuts panel is transparent, but you can choose from a variety of backgrounds or browse and apply your own pictures.\n\nPros:\nYou can organize your shortcuts on a modern and elegant interface, which works like a Start menu. The application is very flexible when it comes to adding shortcuts on its interface. There are various methods of placing new shortcuts and most of them involve a single click. The interface itself can be customized with different background images. \n\nCons:\nThere are no serious drawbacks which should prevent you from using this application. \n\nDesk 365 renders the Start menu obsolete. Once you organize your shortcuts with this elegant application, you will never want to keep any icons on your desktop.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aac55472cf1a3bb762fa622a34b203c0cd223f0","amp;dn":"Desk+365+-+Organize+your+shortcuts+faster+and+easier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aac55472cf1a3bb762fa622a34b203c0cd223f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,172,85,71,44,241,163,187,118,47,166,34,163,75,32,60,12,210,35,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
