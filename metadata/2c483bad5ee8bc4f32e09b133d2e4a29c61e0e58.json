He recorded the contents of this inexorably swinging set in France in 1973 with all-star backing by keyboardists Milt Buckner and Jay McShann, saxists Arnett Cobb and Hal Singer, among others. Brown indulges his passion for Louis Jordan by ripping through &quot;Ain't That Just like a Woman&quot; and &quot;Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens&quot; and exhibits his immaculate fretwork on the torrid title item. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - She winked her eye\n02 - Slow down\n03 - Just lippin'\n04 - My time is expensive\n05 - Ain't nobody here but us chickens\n06 - Pressure cooker\n07 - Ain't that just like a woman\n08 - Deep, deep water\n09 - Cold strings\n\nEnjoy and share!
