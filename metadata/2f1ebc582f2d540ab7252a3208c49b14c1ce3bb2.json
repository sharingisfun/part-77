Each of the five 50-minute episodes looks at a group (or aspect) of the creatures using innovative photographic techniques.\n\nThe series was produced in conjunction with Animal Planet. The executive producer was Mike Gunton, the series producer Mike Salisbury, and the music was composed by Ben Salisbury and David Poore. The Chief Scientific Consultant was Dr. George McGavin.\n\n--\n\nThis soundtrack is entirely unavailable for purchase, so I created mp3s for the masses to listen to.
