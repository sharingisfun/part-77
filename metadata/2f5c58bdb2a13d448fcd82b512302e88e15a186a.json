The tenor always seemed on the verge of exploding and was still in prime form, as can be heard on four basic standards and his blues &quot;Cobb's Idea.&quot; A lesser-known but rewarding effort, one of Cobb's best from his later years. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Cobb's Idea\n02 - Sweet Georgia Brown\n03 - Just A Closer Walk With Thee\n04 - Body And Soul\n05 - I Got Rhythm\n06 - Final Words By Arnett Cobb\n\nEnjoy and share!
