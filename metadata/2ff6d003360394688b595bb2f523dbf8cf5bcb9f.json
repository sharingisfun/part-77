For Harris Stuyvesant, the assignment is a private investigator's dream - he's getting paid to troll the cafÃƒÂ©s and bars of Montparnasse, looking for a pretty young woman. The American agent has a healthy appreciation for la vie de bohÃƒÂ¨me, despite having worked for years at the U.S. Bureau of Investigation. The missing person in question is Philippa Crosby, a twenty-two year old from Boston who has been living in Paris, modeling and acting.
