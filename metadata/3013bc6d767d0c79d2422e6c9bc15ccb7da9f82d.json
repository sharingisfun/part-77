A woman is trapped in a nightmarish place, an isolated zone in a patrolled future city or some dystopian past. In her effort to cross the city and reach the sea, the woman turns to one of her persecutors for help, in whose company she will experience the claustrophobic nightmare around her. The threat of being annihilated by the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmorning patrolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is constant and relentless. Ã¢â‚¬â€Digital Archive\n\n\nÃ£â‚¬â‚¬(It's the near future, and a catastrophe (plague, war, who knows?) has let the few survivors to wander aimlessly in the wild. One of them, a woman, wants only to &quot;go West, to the sea&quot; where she believes life could be better but in order to achieve that, she must go through a ghost city which is guarded by the Morning Patrol (Proini Peripolos). \nÃ£â‚¬â‚¬Ã£â‚¬â‚¬Proini Peripolos is really far from Hollywood movies or blockbusters. It's just an artistic movie with slow pace and it's real power is the setting with grim pictures, atmospheric music and isolated landscapes. Try to find it if you can although the language (it's in Greek) will be a problem for foreign audiences.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3013bc6d767d0c79d2422e6c9bc15ccb7da9f82d","amp;dn":"%E6%B8%85%E6%99%A8%E5%B7%A1%E9%82%8F%E9%9A%8A%281987%29%2FMorning+Patrol%2FProini+peripolos%2F%26Pi%3B%26rho%3B%26omega%3B%26iot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3013bc6d767d0c79d2422e6c9bc15ccb7da9f82d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,19,188,109,118,125,12,121,210,66,46,108,155,193,92,203,125,169,248,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
