Only then does he discover that they have been thrust into the middle of a centuries-old feud between remnants of the Knights Templar and a mysterious clan of assassins; groups whose existence historically ended long ago. Forced by circumstance, the archaeologist reluctantly reunites with his estranged son to interpret these remarkable discoveries. They soon learn that they must follow the ancient path of the TemplarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s or be destroyed.\n\nGenre: Adventure\nIMDB Rating:  5.6/10 from 17 users\nDirected by: Brian Vance, Liliana Corona\nStarring:  Richard Dutcher, Erik Estrada, Joseph James\n\nRelease Name: Templar.Nation.2013.WEBRip.XviD-AQOS\nSize: 700 MiB\nVideo: AVi | 640 x 352 | 1198 kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 128 kbps\nRuntime: 1h 21mn\nSubtitle: N/A","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31ce0b646d298859e63a66aa7f4c02b6cfa11b78","amp;dn":"+Templar+Nation+2013+WEBRip+XviD-AQOS+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31ce0b646d298859e63a66aa7f4c02b6cfa11b78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,206,11,100,109,41,136,89,230,58,102,170,127,76,2,182,207,161,27,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
