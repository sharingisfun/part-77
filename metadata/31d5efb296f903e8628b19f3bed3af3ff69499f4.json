Sort of, because issue three was simply called 'The Foozle' and was a color reprint of an earlier story. CnQaaF was written and illustrated by former Batman artist, Marshall Rogers.\n\nAll three issues are nestled within this torrent. As always, accolades to the creators and scanners. Reap it, sow it!\n\n\n\nYour second Eclipse download opportunity is Scott McCloud's '80s classic, 'Zot!' Begun in 1984, Zot! ran for 36 issues and garnered widespread praise.
