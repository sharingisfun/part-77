Everyone wants to know her, to be with her. But she is interested in Alex. Because Alex is different.\n\nSoon afterwards he is thrown into a world he never thought possible. A world where he and others like him are the last line of defence. A world where an ancient unspeakable evil lurks.\n\nEvil which seeks to consume him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31fe278b8db988f9b8d4ab5bdf86ea13344ce6bc","amp;dn":"The+Awakening+-+Stuart+Meczes.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31fe278b8db988f9b8d4ab5bdf86ea13344ce6bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,254,39,139,141,185,136,249,184,212,171,91,223,134,234,19,52,76,230,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
