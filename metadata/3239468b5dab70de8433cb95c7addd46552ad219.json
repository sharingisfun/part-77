They arrived late and to be honest I could not ask them to close the - already long - row. So I had the reshuffle the row a bit, to reassign a more logical place. No one expects to find Simon &amp; Garfunkel at the bottom.\n\nA lot of work. However, music is a living thing and so some of the other portraits had already undergone some make over. And ordered in five more or less matching rows, it all makes more sense now. So its not too bad to download it again.\n\nAt the other hand, you cannot keep maintaining things for ever. Sometimes its time for something new. So this must be really it. A kind of sketch of old and new Pop Music in 75 Portraits (about 10% I portrayed). All in the best MP3 (unfortunately?) tracks I could find and all ordered (so you can play it as a real Playlist).\n\nDon't be angry if your favorite Band or Song is missing (You are free to add and delete if you wish. If I could, I would have done that already.). I just tried to relive all performed songs as if I would play and sing it myself.\n\nThe songs in which I could radiate the most energy and I was quite sure the original artists would like to be portrayed (Sound), I selected. And ordered the songs like a personal concert, valid for as many people as possible.\n\nI hope the Artists and You can appreciate it.... Enjoy (and listen to these girls and boys; they really have something to say)\n\nPS: I still looking for the two last candidates for my Exceptional Misfits series. Three I have already: Mike Old Field, N.E.R.D. and Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson. Suggestions? ABBA?\n\n\nDutch Treat B001-005 (5 Leading Bands)\n\nB001 Michelle (The Beatles)\n\n 01 The Beatles - Something\n 02 The Beatles - She's Leaving Home\n 03 The Beatles - The Fool On The Hill\n 04 The Beatles - Blackbird\n 05 The Beatles - And I Love Her\n 06 The Beatles - Norwegian Wood\n 07 The Beatles - For No One\n 08 The Beatles - Across The Universe\n 09 The Beatles - I Feel Fine\n 10 The Beatles - Let It Be\n 11 The Beatles - Hey Jude\n 12 The Beatles - Get Back\n 13 The Beatles - Come Together\n 14 The Beatles - Back In The U.S.S.R.\n 15 The Beatles - A Day In The Life\n 16 The Beatles - Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\n 17 The Beatles - Yesterday\n 18 The Beatles - Michelle\n 19 The Beatles - Girl\n 20 The Beatles - Penny Lane\n 21 The Beatles - Strawberry Fields Forever\n 22 The Beatles - The Long And Winding Road\n 23 The Beatles - Help!\n\nB002 Angie (The Rolling Stones)\n\n 01 The Rolling Stones - Hot Stuff\n 02 The Rolling Stones - Fool To Cry\n 03 The Rolling Stones - Angie\n 04 The Rolling Stones - Wild Horses\n 05 The Rolling Stones - Sympathy For The Devil\n 06 The Rolling Stones - Brown Sugar\n 07 The Rolling Stones - Bitch\n 08 The Rolling Stones - Beast Of Burden\n 09 The Rolling Stones - Sister Morphine\n 10 The Rolling Stones - Honky Tonk Women\n 11 The Rolling Stones - Jumpin' Jack Flash\n 12 The Rolling Stones - Paint It, Black\n 13 The Rolling Stones - Satisfaction\n 14 The Rolling Stones - Start Me Up\n 15 The Rolling Stones - Miss You\n 16 The Rolling Stones - Heaven\n 17 The Rolling Stones - I Got The Blues\n 18 The Rolling Stones - As Tears Go By\n 19 The Rolling Stones - Ruby Tuesday\n\nB003 Hey You (Pink Floyd)\n\n 01 Pink Floyd - Time\n 02 Pink Floyd - The Great Gig In The Sky\n 03 Pink Floyd - Wot's...
