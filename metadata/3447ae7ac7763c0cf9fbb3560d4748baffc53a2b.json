Get over it.&quot; \n\nFrogwings began as an Allman Brothers/Aquarium Rescue Unit side project in 1997, with Edwin McCain as the lead singer. The band ran off five gigs in seven days in late May 1997, and the jazz/rock/calypso/metal fusion began. \n\nFounding members Butch Trucks [drums] and Jimmy Herring [guitar] were joined by the Burbridge brothers, Kofi [flute] and Oteil [bass], as well as Butch's nephew Derek [guitar/, and band and percussion-mate Marc Quinones. \n\nThe successful May run was followed by a two-week trip up and down the East coast in December, and this run cemented Frogwings as a permanent part of the Allman Brothers Band sideshow.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3447ae7ac7763c0cf9fbb3560d4748baffc53a2b","amp;dn":"Frogwings+-+1997-05-28+-+Covered+Dish+in+Gainesville%2C+FL+++SBD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3447ae7ac7763c0cf9fbb3560d4748baffc53a2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,71,174,122,199,118,60,12,249,251,179,86,13,71,72,186,255,197,58,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
