What is odd is that, at fifty years old, Varamo Ã¢â‚¬Å“hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t previously written one sole verse, nor had it ever occurred to him to write one.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nAmong other things, this novella is an ironic allegory of the poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocation and inspiration, the subtlety of artistic genius, and our need to give literature an historic, national, psychological, and aesthetic context. But Aira goes further still Ã¢â‚¬â€ converting the ironic allegory into a formidable parody of the expectations that all narrative texts generate Ã¢â‚¬â€ by laying out the pathos of a man who between one night and the following morning is touched by genius. Once again Aira surprises us with his unclassifiable fiction: original and enjoyable, worthy of many a thoughtful chuckle, Varamo invites the reader to become an accomplice in the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s irresistible game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:364758c48a5e40dc45d800df4ad7b48d911f822d","amp;dn":"Varamo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"364758c48a5e40dc45d800df4ad7b48d911f822d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,71,88,196,138,94,64,220,69,216,0,223,74,215,180,141,145,31,130,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
