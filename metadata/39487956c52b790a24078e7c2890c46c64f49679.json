From the obvious to the unlikely and all points in between, they're yet to put a foot wrong in their performance and interpretation of whatever track they tackle.\n\nPaul spent some time in the studio recording a selection of the covers as the one-off EP, &quot;Shotgun Karaoke&quot;.\n\n\nCODEC:\t\t\tMPEG-1, Layer 3 (.mp3)\nBIT RATE:\t\t320 kbps\nCHANNELS:\t\tJoint Stereo\nSAMPLE RATE:\t\t44100 Hz\nID3 TAG:        \tv2.3\nENCODED WITH:\t\tExact Audio Copy 1.0b3 (EAC) using LAME3.99\nALBUM COVER:\t\tYes (954 x 960px)\n\n\n\n\n01.
