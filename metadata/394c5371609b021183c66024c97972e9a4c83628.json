Spy. Mistress. Anxious to secure his own success at the glittering court of Henry VIII, heiress Tamsin LodgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ambitious guardian obtains her a position as maid of honor to young Princess Mary Tudor. Tamsin soon comes to love the neglected child, but in the Tudor court, not even a princess is secure. MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father is besotted with the lovely Anne Boleyn, and the girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future has grown perilous. Plotting to be MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes and ears, Tamsin joins AnneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s service, but the handsome silk worker who is her co-conspirator may be her undoing. While marriage with a merchant is unthinkable, she cannot resist Rafe PinckneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s embraces. When Tamsin also attracts the lusty Henry, she must choose between loyalty and desire. . . . With AnneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jealousy growing dangerous, can Tamsin survive the schemes and seductions that surround her?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:394c5371609b021183c66024c97972e9a4c83628","amp;dn":"The+King%27s+Damsel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"394c5371609b021183c66024c97972e9a4c83628","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,76,83,113,96,155,2,17,131,198,96,36,201,121,114,233,164,200,54,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
