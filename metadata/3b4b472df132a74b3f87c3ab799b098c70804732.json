The game went into Alpha on October 31st, 2012, and eventually it will allow you to drive cars, barricade windows, craft items, explore diverse areas, and kill zombies. Lots of zombies. With an initial Windows release and with Mac and Linux releases to follow, you can buy The Dead Linger now for a discounted price of $19.99. Dragging the zombie survival genre back into reality, the game requires you to use your head and stay on your toes to stave off the zombie horde. You are not alone, however: in LAN or Internet-based multiplayer you can compete or cooperate with up to 16 other players. \n\n\n\n\n=====================================================================================\n\nInstructions:\n\nExtract &amp; Play! ^_-\n\n=====================================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b4b472df132a74b3f87c3ab799b098c70804732","amp;dn":"The+Dead+Linger+%28Steam+Early+Access%29+%283DM%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b4b472df132a74b3f87c3ab799b098c70804732","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,75,71,45,241,50,167,75,63,135,195,171,121,155,9,140,112,128,71,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
