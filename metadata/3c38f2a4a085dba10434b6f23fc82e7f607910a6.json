All the songs were written by frontman Alex Gaskarth and Mike Green, with &quot;Outlines&quot; co-written by Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy. Don't Panic sees All Time Low further evolving their sound while taking influence from each of their previous releases. The album debuted at No. 6 on the US Billboard 200 with 48,000 first week sales, making it the band's third top 10 debut in a row. It also became the group's first album to reach No. 1 on the Top Internet Albums chart. It peaked at No. 9 in the UK and in the top 20 in Australia and Canada. All Time Low has continued touring year-long in support of Don't Panic. The album received critical acclaim, with critics praising Gaskarth's song writing and the album's sound as a whole.\n\nThere is a re-release of the album with a slightly altered album cover set for September 30, 2013, featuring previously unheard tracks and bonus versions. The single &quot;A Love Like War&quot; exclusive to the re-release, which features guest vocals from Vic Fuentes of Pierce the Veil, reached No. 23 on Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100, and No. 17 on Billboard Hot Rock Songs.\n\nAll lyrics written by Alex Gaskarth and Mike Green except listed, all music composed by Alex Gaskarth and Mike Green.\n\n1.\t&quot;The Reckless and the Brave&quot;  \t \t        3:19\n2.\t&quot;A Love Like War&quot;                \t \t3:33\n3.\t&quot;Backseat Serenade&quot;  \t \t                3:21\n4.\t&quot;Me Without You (All I Ever Wanted)&quot;  \t \t3:33\n5.\t&quot;If These Sheets Were States&quot;  \t         \t3:19\n6.\t&quot;Somewhere in Neverland&quot;  \t        \t3:45\n7.\t&quot;So Long, Soldier&quot;  \t                  \t2:49\n8.\t&quot;Canals&quot;  \t \t                        3:22\n9.\t&quot;The Irony of Choking on a Lifesaver&quot;  \t \t3:36\n10.\t&quot;To Live and Let Go&quot;  \t \t                3:43\n11.\t&quot;Outlines&quot;  \t                                3:35\n12.\t&quot;Thanks to You&quot;  \t \t                3:34\n13.\t&quot;For Baltimore&quot;  \t \t                3:09\n14.\t&quot;Paint You Wings&quot;  \t \t                3:40\n15.\t&quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Booze&quot;  \t3:09\n16.\t&quot;Oh Calamity!&quot;  \t \t                3:46\n17.\t&quot;For Baltimore (Acoustic)&quot;  \t        \t3:29\n18.\t&quot;Somewhere In Neverland (Acoustic)&quot;  \t \t3:40\n19.\t&quot;The Reckless And The Brave (Acoustic)&quot;  \t3:37\n20.\t&quot;Backseat Serenade (Acoustic)&quot;                  3:14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c38f2a4a085dba10434b6f23fc82e7f607910a6","amp;dn":"Don%27t+Panic%3A+It%27s+Longer+Now%21+-+All+Time+Low","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c38f2a4a085dba10434b6f23fc82e7f607910a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,56,242,164,160,133,219,161,4,52,182,242,63,200,46,127,96,121,16,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
