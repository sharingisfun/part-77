I picked up the record on the basis that it was mentioned in one of the early issues of the pioneering rock mag &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; and was immediately drawn in by the fantastic cover art. Seriously, this has got to be one of my favorite record sleeves of all time. Great colors and a wonderful image of the sad-eyed lady in the wicker chair with the band's name spelled out in psychedelic letters-- &quot;timeless&quot;, indeed!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c724070622653032c232f244a3c548bc34e2edd","amp;dn":"Alexander%27s+Timeless+Bloozband+-+For+Sale+%281968%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c724070622653032c232f244a3c548bc34e2edd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,114,64,112,98,38,83,3,44,35,47,36,74,60,84,139,195,78,46,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
