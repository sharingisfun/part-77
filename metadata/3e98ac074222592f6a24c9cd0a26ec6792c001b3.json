They decide to age one of the photos and discover that it is of Nathan as a child. He contacts the person who placed the photo to find out what's going on. The person on the other end only wants to know info about Nathan, so Nathan hangs up. That person then contacts someone in Europe and shows him a photo of the one who called. He then heads for the U.S. Nathan then wonders if it's true he was abducted. He tells his &quot;mom&quot; who then tells him she and his &quot;father&quot; will tell him. But before they can, two men claiming to be cops show up wanting to talk to Nathan, and when he isn't found they pull guns and demand Nathan be given to them. His parents fight them but are killed.
