Everyone is a fan of somebody whose progress through life makes the fan feel old. In my case, that person is Robyn Hitchcock. I remember when hardly anyone in America had heard of him. And he's been recording for almost 35 years. Amazing.\n\nThe CDs in this set are:\n\n1) The Soft Boys - A Can of Bees 1979 (Rykodisc)\n\n2) Black Snake Diamond Role 1981 (Rhino)\n\n3) I Often Dream of Trains 1984 (Rhino)\n\n4) Perspex Island 1991 (A&amp;M) - with The Egyptians\n\n5) The Kershaw Sessions 1994 (Strange Roots Records)- a compilation of recordings made strictly for BBC broadcast - with The Egyptians\n\n6) Jewels for Sophia 1999 (Warner Brothers)\n\n7) Goodnight Oslo 2009 (Yep Roc Records) - with Venus 3\n\nThe first 3 discs in the series include bonus tracks. \n\nI Often Dream of Trains in CD form is LADEN with bonus tracks - the original vinyl LP included tracks 1-7 and 13-19, and while I enjoy some of the additions on the CD the original 14 track LP was more severe and interesting.\n\nJewels for Sophia has a hidden song at the end of the last track - wait for it.
