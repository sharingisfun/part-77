This recording was made by the &quot;professor&quot;, who reputedly smugged his reel-reel recorder into the venue under a large poncho. \n\nThis show has long been my personal favourite of all the extant Tea Party recordings. Lou and Sterling's guitar playing is outstanding, and Moe never misses a beat. &quot;Move Right In&quot; is just great - Sterling sounds just like a tape loop and Lou's &quot;improvised on the spot&quot; lyrics are tantalisingly almost intelligible. &quot;Foggy Notion&quot; is a joyful breeze, with buzzsaw guitars and fine vocals. Going by Lou's introduction, this would appear to be the first public performance of &quot;Candy Says&quot;. It's certainly the only Velvets recording of it which I am aware of where Lou actually sings it himself - he cant quite reach the high notes but there's a certain weary tenderness to his vocal which I dont think Doug ever managed to achieve, live or in the studio. This is undoubtedly my favourite version of one of my favourite songs.
