Acclaimed sociologist Christian Smith argues that this approach is misguided and unable to live up to its own claims. If evangelical biblicism worked as its proponents say it should, there would not be the vast variety of interpretive differences that biblicists themselves reach when they actually read and interpret the Bible. Far from challenging the inspiration and authority of Scripture, Smith critiques a particular rendering of it, encouraging evangelicals to seek a more responsible, coherent, and defensible approach to biblical authority.\n\nThis important book has generated lively discussion and debate. The paperback edition adds a new chapter responding to the conversation that the cloth edition has sparked.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40f353c74fa08bc41989c71a9da08abfc3c3f03c","amp;dn":"The+Bible+Made+Impossible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40f353c74fa08bc41989c71a9da08abfc3c3f03c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,243,83,199,79,160,139,196,25,137,199,26,157,160,138,191,195,195,240,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
