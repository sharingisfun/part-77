Sen. Rand Paul disapproves of the immigration reform bill and believes the House will kill it. Also, the world governments collide in confrontation over Edward Snowden, whose current whereabouts are unknown. The U.S. demands extradition for the NSA spy gate whistleblower but finds little international support. Alex considers new evidence in the vehicle death of Michael Hastings which may indicate that his car's electronics were controlled remotely. \n\nAlex hosts Sheriff Richard Mack in studio, a former Arizona sheriff, author, and successful Bill of Rights activist. Mack is renowned for his Supreme Court victory against gun control. Mack is the author of The Magic of Gun Control, available now at the Infowars Shop. \n\nIn addition, Coast to Coast AM radio host George Noory calls into the show.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
