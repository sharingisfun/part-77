Bought this from South Africa to share with you guys! Please read the &quot;readme&quot; and PLEASE seed. Don't download and remove. This is a brand new torrent and the only one as of right now so support and love it like a child! Also please say thanks for my purchase and sharing. I know your not going to be happy I didn't rip it through iTunes or something like that but the first sharing should be as authentic to the original as possible. Just burn the .cue file to a blank CD using a good ISO burning software and then you can rip it and tag it yourself how you like. I would also like to say after you enjoy this version, you should buy the American/UK version when it releases July 23rd, 2013 to support the artist. I think this album will make you WANT to buy the real thing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4246885936c298c9956a24c2a926eafcf1506881","amp;dn":"Basshunter+-+Calling+Time+%28South+African+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4246885936c298c9956a24c2a926eafcf1506881","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,70,136,89,54,194,152,201,149,106,36,194,169,38,234,252,241,80,104,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
