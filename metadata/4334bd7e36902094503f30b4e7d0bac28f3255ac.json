When Chris selects Ashley for transformation, he's surprised to have her husband, Jason, also jump on board the program. In the first 90 days, Chris sets up a special workout with the gold medal-winning U.S. Olympic Softball team and Ashley's favorite player, Jenny Finch. Since she's an aspiring landscape photographer, Chris sends Ashley to Peru at the 6-month mark, where she and Jason hike Machu Pichu for the ultimate photo shoot. Having never fully mourned her daughter's death, Chris encourages the family to have a memorial service for her as part of the healing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4334bd7e36902094503f30b4e7d0bac28f3255ac","amp;dn":"Extreme.Weight.Loss.S03E11.Ashley.HDTV.x264.NY2.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4334bd7e36902094503f30b4e7d0bac28f3255ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,52,189,126,54,144,32,148,80,63,48,180,231,208,186,194,143,50,85,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
