There is truth here for all ages and beliefs. If Darwin was wrong...........then the Schools have been intentionally lying to our Children. If the schools teach Darwinism which says there is NO CHRIST. Then they are of The Anti-Christ. Public Schools teaching books CHANGE EVERY YEAR. The Bible never changes. So where is truth??? In Evolution Theories??? If you believe in Evolution you are denying The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit of the Praise They are entitled too for making everything you understand and can see and more than that, everything you don't understand and can't see. If you have never thanked the CREATOR for his Creation now is your chance to thank Him.\n\nPOtHS - Creation - 70 - What The Fossils Say\nDescription:\n\nDinosaurs and Man Coexisted - Evidence from Acambaro, Mexico by Dr. Don Patton:\nPictures &amp; Info atÃ‡â‚¬ The Dinosaur Figurines Of Acambaro, Mexico\nAmazing evidence that dinosaurs and humans coexisted.\n\nIn 1945 Waldemar Julsrud, a German immigrant and knowledgeable archeologist, discovered clay figurines buried at the foot of El Toro Mountain on the outskirts of Acambaro, Guanajuato, Mexico. Eventually over 33,000 ceramic figurines were found near El Toro as well as Chivo Mountain on the other side of town. Similar artifacts found in the area are identified with the Pre-classical Chupicuaro Culture (800 BC to 200 AD).\n\n\nEphesians 5:11\n\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n           \n     \n:thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44075dd471e64b65261772094438a0ad9f7559cd","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Creation+-+70+-+What+The+Fossils+Say","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44075dd471e64b65261772094438a0ad9f7559cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,7,93,212,113,230,75,101,38,23,114,9,68,56,160,173,159,117,89,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
