I meant to do it sooner but i got distracting writing 8 more novels. It happens. Now I am in the process of re-editing the novels.\n\nIn this case, a lot of changes were made creating more a more fluent reading experience. A lot of grammar fix ups, some things added and some tings removed. And all new artwork.\n\nThe same will be done for b00k 011; UTOPIAN CIRCUS, which I will start editing next week.\n\n\nA Rising Fall is the first book in a dystopian trilogy entitled City:aliteraryconcerto. \n\nThe story starts ten years after the blackout as a group of humans struggling to fight off a conscious famine, try to re-learn empathy to save humanity in an old industrial assembly plant. \n\nIn 3 days; feigned affection, deception and a black heart will take them further into the repression of their own fears in search of unconditional love. \n\nThe City Concerto through literary prose; answers one question: To what lengths would a father go and what horrible wrongs would he do, to teach a god how to love again?\n\nFollowing the theme of a concerto, City is divided into three parts; A Rising Fall, Utopian Circus and I, Cannibal. Each book is then divided into three pieces and with A Rising Fall, each piece refers to a day; the three days leading to the fall of their city. \n\nThe trilogy illustrates the human emancipation from three states of love; Eros, Philos and Agape as each is torn apart under the guise of well intention as humanity; now void of identity in the wake of a century of dehumanising dependence and necessity upon industry and digital technology; has separated itself from the labour of its existence, aborting empathy and setting in place the death of mother nature. Yet, on the verge of extinction; mankind presses on; towards salvation; towards the city of light and sound; towards New Utopia.\n\nTake Risk and Take Care,\n\nC.
