I uploaded these so that everyone will have a chance to see what the demos were like, if you're interested in hacking and exploring the older forbidden lands of Shadow of the Colossus. Enjoy! Please seed if you download. I will make sure this torrent doesn't die out because everyone deserves a chance to own these.\n\nI RECOMMEND USING PCSX2 FOR THESE ISO FILES. I do not know anything about hacking the PS2 so please don't ask me for help on that. An emulator is where you'll get the best experience anyway.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44cdd1e244a577b94482e5818807edf1509ef7cf","amp;dn":"Shadow+of+the+Colossus+DEMOS+%28OPM%2C+PSU%2C+and+PAL%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44cdd1e244a577b94482e5818807edf1509ef7cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,205,209,226,68,165,119,185,68,130,229,129,136,7,237,241,80,158,247,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
