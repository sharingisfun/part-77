Some buzzing in quiter parts as well, this is not a recording fault, it was coming from some electrical wires nearby. Show was ended early due to lightning in the area and a light rain, it was pretty windy at points but it doesn't sound like it caused any problems with the recording.\n\n\nPieta Brown \n\n-http://www.pietabrown.com/home.cfm- \n\n\n1.
