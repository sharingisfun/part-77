Make her fall in love with him.\nHer challenge? Play the player.\nUntil life changes the rules of the game.\n\nMaddie Stevens hated Braden Carter on sight. Arrogant, egotistical, and the playboy of the University of California, Berkeley, he's everything her brother Pearce has taught her to despise. So why, when the girls challenge her to play the player, doesn't she say no? She doesn't know either.\n\nBraden wanted fiery little Maddie the second he laid eyes on her - and he'd do anything to have her, hence why he's agreed to make her fall in love with him. After all, it's the only way he'll get what he wants. Sex.\n\nBut, as Braden discovers, there's more to the girl from Brooklyn than he ever imagined - and he can't help but care about the broken girl behind those pretty green eyes.\n\nMaddie finds Braden isn't just a walking erection - he actually has feelings. He can be sweet, funny and his good looks don't exactly hurt. That means trouble - but when her brother Pearce turns up in Berkeley begging for her help, she realises Braden and Pearce aren't so alike anymore.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, they're exactly what each other needs.\n\nPlaying For Keeps (The Game #2) by Emma Hart (June 24th 2013)\n\nShe's in love with him. \nHe's trying not to love her. \nOne night changes everything.\n\nAston Banks never meant to get close to Megan Harper Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not even for that one night. Haunted by a childhood he refuses to face, he knew she could break through every wall heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ever built and tear them down without even realizing she was doing it. \n\nBetraying Braden by starting a relationship with Aston wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t on MeganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to-do list, but the second she sees a glimpse of someone other than the arrogant ass sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s come to know, she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t walk away. \n\nAstonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s childhood is worse than Megan ever guessed, but as he tries and fails to push her away, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear her love is stronger than the demons that cling to him every day. And now, because of it, he finally has to deal with what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s buried deep down. \n\nWhat he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to face. What heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fought against for so long. \n\nAnd they have to do it all without Braden finding out.\n\nKeeping a relationship secret has never been harder.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:469d6270d86aa06d12a6848d23fc49ccb307bc88","amp;dn":"The+Game+Series+%281-2%29+by+Emma+Hart+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"469d6270d86aa06d12a6848d23fc49ccb307bc88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,157,98,112,216,106,160,109,18,166,132,141,35,252,73,204,179,7,188,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
