Martial artist Chen Ping (Tiger Chen) works in a shop in the tourist town of Dalongwan (Big Dragon Valley), Yunshan municipality. One evening his boss Wu San (Johnny Yuen), on the run from some criminal associates he's double-crossed, drops off a hamper at the shop. Inside, Chen Ping finds an eight-year-old American boy, Christopher (Arman Darbo). Wu San is killed by his associates, led by Hama (AndrÃƒÂ© &quot;Chyna&quot; McCoy), who then come looking for Christopher at the shop. Chen Ping temporarily escapes with the boy, but next day the kidnappers, joined by their leader Susan (Vanessa Branch), return. Chen Ping and Christopher flee again, and Susan, pretending to be his mother, asks the help of the local police in finding him. Chen Ping and Christopher hide out with an English teacher from Beijing, Liu Jie (Jiang Mengjie), who helps them. Christopher is, in fact, the son of multi-millionaire John Schmidt (Aaron Horrell) and was kidnapped by Susan, his tutor, and Hama, his bodyguard, while attending a cousin's birthday in Burma; he was then smuggled across the border into China by Wu San, who betrayed them to make some extra money. Schmidt's assistant, Sean (Igor Darbo), who is secretly working for Susan, tips off the kidnappers that Schmidt and his wife (Joanna Riley Weidenmiller) are flying to Port City to rescue their son. Meanwhile, Chen Ping, Christopher and Liu Jie go on the run from both the kidnappers and the local police.\n\nReleased in China hot on the heels of Man of Tai Chi Ã¥Â¤ÂªÃ¦Â¥ÂµÃ¤Â¿Â , Kung Fu Man Ã¥Å Å¸Ã¥Â¤Â«Ã¤Â¾Â  turns out to be an earlier collaboration between Mainland-born stuntman Tiger CHEN Ã©â„¢Â³Ã¨â„¢Å½ and Canadian actor Keanu REEVES that was shot almost four years ago. Chen's first leading role, and reminiscent of any number of straight-to-video Hong Kong action films of the '80s, it's an OK showcase for the diminutive, Sichuan-born martial arts champion but is more interesting for its production history than anything else.\n\nVideo: RealVideo 4 640x420 [Video]\nAudio: RealAudio COOK 44100Hz stereo 1411kbps [Audio]\nMandarin, English w/ Eng subs.\n\nScreens:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46ed7e6602f893259dd36be55e93cfa205a988c4","amp;dn":"Kung+Fu+Man+%282013%29+TS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46ed7e6602f893259dd36be55e93cfa205a988c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,237,126,102,2,248,147,37,157,211,107,229,94,147,207,162,5,169,136,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
