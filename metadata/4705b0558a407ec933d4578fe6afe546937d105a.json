I realized the fact that it isn't about building your song library to brag about, it's about expressing yourself through music, putting feeling into the airwaves that one calls music. \n\nThe album goes through my memories and takes little bits and pieces from everywhere, binding them all together and distorting them a little. It's a nice little trip inside my thoughts.\n\nTracklist:\n01 Carefully Sinking Through Ice\n02 Lights Frightened The Captain\n03 Ground Shook Beneath Our Feet\n04 Reach For The Stars Above\n05 Arms Like Wings\n06 Sleep. Forgive. Live.\n07 YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Be Safe Here\n08 So Long, My Dear Friend\n09 As We Talk, The Universe Slowly Spins\n10 If We CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t See The End\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4705b0558a407ec933d4578fe6afe546937d105a","amp;dn":"Stars+As+Lights+-+As+If+Time+Had+Stopped+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4705b0558a407ec933d4578fe6afe546937d105a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,5,176,85,138,64,126,201,51,212,87,143,230,175,229,70,147,125,16,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
