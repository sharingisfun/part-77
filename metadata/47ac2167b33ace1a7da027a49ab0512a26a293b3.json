Just Play.\n\nZygor Guides is an in-game software strategy guide for World of Warcraft. Every guide comes complete with the Guide Viewer, which displays step by step instructions of what quests to accept, how to complete objectives, when to use items, and more. Our gorgeous waypoint arrow will point you exactly where to go at all times and the model viewer will display fully rendered 3D models of NPCs and objects mentioned in the guide.\n\nZygor's Leveling Guide includes the most optimized questing path for power leveling from 1-90 in lightning speed. The guide software is very dynamic, tracking your progress, detecting when you complete goals, and automating tedious tasks such as accepting and turning in quests. You will be amazed by the difference Zygor makes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47ac2167b33ace1a7da027a49ab0512a26a293b3","amp;dn":"Zygor+Guides+4.0.7070+%28August+22nd%2C+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47ac2167b33ace1a7da027a49ab0512a26a293b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,172,33,103,179,58,206,26,125,160,39,164,154,176,81,42,38,162,147,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
