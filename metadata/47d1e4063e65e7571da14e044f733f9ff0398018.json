Like the KINKS, they missed out on the credit they so rightly\n\ndeserved.  Rightness is in severely short supply presently.\n\n\nWhat strikes me like a meteorite is the consistent high quality of most\n\nBadfinger songs.  The only dubious tune in this compilation (once again IMO)\n\nis track #5 MAYBE TOMORROW, but I only know what I like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47d1e4063e65e7571da14e044f733f9ff0398018","amp;dn":"Badfinger+THE+VERY+BEST+OF...%282000+issue%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47d1e4063e65e7571da14e044f733f9ff0398018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,209,228,6,62,101,231,87,29,161,78,4,79,115,63,159,240,57,128,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
