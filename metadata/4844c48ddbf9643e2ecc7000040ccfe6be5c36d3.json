This mod was not made to see Native multiplayer how I want to see it, but rather every decision and change was done with great thought and care as well as complete objectivity.\nAnother focus of this mod was to keep things Native. It uses 90% Native assets and textures. Supplements were introduced where necessary, and I did my best to make them fit in with the look and feel of Native.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4844c48ddbf9643e2ecc7000040ccfe6be5c36d3","amp;dn":"ProMod+-+Mount+%26amp%3B+Blade+%3A+Warband","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4844c48ddbf9643e2ecc7000040ccfe6be5c36d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,68,196,141,219,249,100,62,46,204,112,0,4,12,207,230,190,92,54,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
