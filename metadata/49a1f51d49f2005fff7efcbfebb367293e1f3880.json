Whilst his outlook may seem lavish at various junctures, the intimacy of this project remains. The tunes remain highly personal, intricate and more importantly, intensely appealing. The music and performances, are of course perfectly credible, with nothing  left to the vagaries (or luxuries) of a computerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cutting room folder.\n\n  In short, Images Rolling appears to be an individualÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long awaited masterpiece. A relaxed effort, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been carefully considered with only the ripest of ideas making the final cut. Nearer the end of the album, you really do feel as though you have been taken on a journey. Under The Eaves is a contradiction in simplicity versus complexity. The chords are easy to remember, but the layering and overall arrangement builds up to a gentle crescendo, that for Rigelsford is pleasantly epic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49a1f51d49f2005fff7efcbfebb367293e1f3880","amp;dn":"Magic+Arm+-+Images+Rolling+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49a1f51d49f2005fff7efcbfebb367293e1f3880","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,161,245,29,73,242,0,95,255,126,252,191,235,179,103,41,62,31,56,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
