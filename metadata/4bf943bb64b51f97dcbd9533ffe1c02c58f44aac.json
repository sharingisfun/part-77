So I created my own after having to take it twice.  The answers aren't &quot;official&quot; because I don't have the official answer key, but I tried my hardest to answer them correctly.  Most people take this test when applying at manufacturing or engineering companies.    Included is also an electrical test that was given to me, I don't know how standard it is, but I added it any way.  \n\n   I hope that this answer key will help you in getting a job.  Know the answers and the logic behind them though, this doesn't give you an excuse to be stupid.\n\n   Please add any corrections you find in the comments below.  A scan of the original answer key would be awesome as well.  Thanks and God bless.
