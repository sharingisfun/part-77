In addition to creating a unique musical sound, he has won praise for his power as a lyricist. His precisely worded narratives, with their sense of humour about daily life, stand as metaphors for the social and economic ills that bedevil his country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c0b8ec2c1d89394aa8c9293b651f3c719685fa8","amp;dn":"Oliver+Mutukudzi_Neria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c0b8ec2c1d89394aa8c9293b651f3c719685fa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,11,142,194,193,216,147,148,170,140,146,147,182,81,243,199,25,104,95,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
