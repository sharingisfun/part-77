Netcat is often referred \ntoas a Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Swiss Army knifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ utility, and for good reason. Just like the multi-function usefulness of the venerable Swiss Army pocket knife, NetcatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s functionality is helpful as both \na standalone program and a back-end tool in a wide range of applications. Some of the \nmany uses of Netcat include port scanning, transferring files, grabbing banners, port \nlistening and redirection, and more nefariously, a backdoor.\nThere is some debate on the origin of the name Netcat, but one of the more \ncommon (and believable) explanations is that Netcat is simply a network version of \nthe vulnerable catprogram. Just as cat reads and writes information to files, Netcat \nreads and writes information across network connections. Furthermore, Netcat is \nspecifically designed to behave as cat does.\nOriginally coded for UNIX, and despite not originally being maintained on a \nregular basis, Netcat has been rewritten into a number of versions and implementations. It has been ported to a number of operating systems, but is most often seen on \nvarious Linux distributions as well as Microsoft Windows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c95e24d30c6475feb7cbff335ccd23752df5ad5","amp;dn":"netcat+nc111nt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c95e24d30c6475feb7cbff335ccd23752df5ad5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,149,226,77,48,198,71,95,235,124,191,243,53,204,210,55,82,223,90,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
