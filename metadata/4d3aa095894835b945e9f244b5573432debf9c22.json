The latter will allow BBM users to set up groups to share calendar, photos, files, etc.\n\nTo refresh your memory, a month ago, the BBM app for Android was in its beta testing stages and then we got to see some leaked screenshots of the apps interface. If the latest promises from company officials are anything to go by, we should expect the full version of the app to hit both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store by the end of this month.\n\nDespite the app not being usable at this point, you can enjoy the login and user registration screens by following the source link below and downloading the .APK file.\n\n\nIf torrent ain't working check from below:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://techweeknd.com/official-leaked-version-of-bbmblackberry-messenger/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://techweeknd.com/official-leaked-version-of-bbmblackberry-messenger/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d3aa095894835b945e9f244b5573432debf9c22","amp;dn":"BBM%26quot%3Bblack+berry+messnger.apk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d3aa095894835b945e9f244b5573432debf9c22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,58,160,149,137,72,53,185,69,233,242,68,181,87,52,50,222,191,156,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
