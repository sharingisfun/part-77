That is The Part that THEY DIDN&quot;T get right. To get Jesus now scroll down the Page. It is just a couple things you need to do and you can do it alone in your Room right now. Time is Short Friends.\n\nDescription:\n\nRavi at Princeton University - Why I'm Not an Atheist:\n\nRavi Zacharias and Vince Vitale spoke an overflow crowd at Princeton University with the faculty and students titled, &quot;Why I'm Not An Atheist.&quot;  The auditorium was filled to capacity and several students remarked that the event was the Ã¢â‚¬ËœbuzzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in many conversations on campus all week.\n\nWarmly and thoughtfully, Dr. Zacharias presented his reasons as to why he thought Atheism was not a viable belief or foundation to base a world view on.  He presented many valid, logical answers supporting his view while respecting the opposing viewpoint, with sincerity and confidence.\n\nHighlighting one particular question and the answer given by Vince Vitale, a Princeton Graduate and member of Ravi ZachariasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ International Ministry staff.  A student from Ukraine, asked this:\n&quot;If the essence of God is to create and realize the infinte potential for creation, and He desires His children to capitulate His nature and continue His work, would not the act of creation itaself become and act of vanity?&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Great Debate with Dr. Hovind vs Dr. Michael Shermer - Creationism vs evolution:\nSubtitled: Biblical Creation, Theistic Evolution, Evolution\nApril 25th, 2003 Dr. Hovind takes on Kyle Frazier and Dr. Michael Shermer at Emmanuel Christian Center, Minneapolis, MN.\n\nIn this debate Kent Hovind defends the position that the Bible is literally true, the earth is six thousand years old and the evolution theory is retarded. Kyle Frazier maintains the position that the earth is billions of years old, but God created it. This is commonly called the Theistic Evolution Position or the Progressive Creation Position. Michael Shermer, editor of Skeptic Magazine and author of How to Debate a Creationist, maintains the position that there is no God necessary and evolution can explain everything.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEvidence vs. Faith - Creation Today Season 3 Episode 8:\nEvidence or faith? Upon which are your beliefs and your witness based? Paul and Eric discuss what people say, and what the Bible says, about these two terms. Gain understanding of real evidence and real faith to boldly and effectively witness to others!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDEBATE Phil Donahue, Duane Gish, Evolution vs. Creation:\nThis debate took place on Bob Hoskins' TV show called FEED BACK. Creation Life Publishers had a connection with the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), and Dr. John Morris, ICR President, gave me permission on April 5, 2013 to upload this video.\n\n\nTowards the end of this debate, it becomes evident that the entire battle of evolution vs creationism is simply one of religion vs religion and not about the sciences. Unfortunately that is not what is taught in school. Under pretense of science, they actually teach evolution as a counter religion and this program sheds a minor light onto that topic. People need to realize religion, no matter which kind - e.g. christianity or evolution, should not be taught as science. For real science, not fake or disproved, is only what students should learn in science coursses. Religion falls into religious or philosophical ciriculum.\n\nDoes God Exist? A debate with William Lane Craig vs Peter Millican:\nAt Birmingham University, October 2011. This debate on &quot;Does God Exist?&quot; took place in front of a capacity audience at the Great Hall, University of Birmingham. It was recorded on Friday 21st October 2011 as part of the UK Reasonable Faith Tour with William Lane Craig.  Although there are many problems in the evolutionist rebuttals, Dr. Craig only focuses on a few and lets the others apprarantly slide by (at least for this debate).\n\nWilliam Lane Craig is Research Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology, La Mirada, California and a leading philosopher of religion.  Peter Millican is Gilbert Ryle Professor of Philosophy at Hertford College, University of Oxford and a noted scholar in studies of Hume.  The debate was hosted by the University of Birmingham Student Philosophy Society, and the debate was moderated by Professor Carl Chinn.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHugh Ross vs Kent Hovind - How Old Is The Earth?\nHugh Ross presents and defends a biblical basis for believing that the earth is billions (not thousands) of years old. Speaking for the young-earth (YEC) position is Kent Hovind.\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d94270e888ddcfb007659e76211a136609f2df5","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Creation+-+78+-+Why+Im+Not+an+Atheist_+Debates","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d94270e888ddcfb007659e76211a136609f2df5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,148,39,14,136,141,220,251,0,118,89,231,98,17,161,54,96,159,45,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
