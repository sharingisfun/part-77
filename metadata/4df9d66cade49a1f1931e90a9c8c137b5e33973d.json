They are everywhere. Check out the Latest here.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBelief in UFOs and extra-terrestrials is fast becoming the high tech religion for the new millenium. We are witnessing more and more reports of UFO sightings, hearing reports of abductions, and seeing many extreme and bizarre New Age UFO cults emerge.\n\nFirstly, we will ask the question - Do UFOs actually exist, or are they just a fantasy, a product of the mind? Secondly - If they do exist then what exactly are they? Thirdly, we will ask - Who or what are behind them? And finally, I will go into detail as to what I personally feel about this subject, as a Christian, and will examine what I believe the Bible has to say on the matter.\n\nDo UFOs actually exist?\n\nSo do UFOs actually exist? In the mind of those in the film industry there is no doubt to this question. UFOs and aliens exist on the big screen and small screen alike in such things as: Independence Day, The X Files, Dark Skies, Men in Black, Mars Attack, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. And recently there is the renewed interest in the film Star Wars, even though it was originally shown about 20 years ago. Then there is everyone's favourite Star Trek, where you can boldly go where no man has gone before and join Captain Kirk, and Spock and the crew to encounter a wide assortment of colourful life-forms in a Universe that is chock-a-block with alien life. Certainly, in the world of Science Fiction UFO's not only exist, but are here to stay.\n\nBut what about reality? Do UFOs really exist? The modern UFO era began in 1947 when a man by the name of Kenneth Arnold witnessed 9 disk shaped objects flying at tremendous speeds over Washington. A reporter coined the phrase &quot;Flying Saucer&quot; and the phrase stuck. It appears that after Arnold's sighting the flood gates opened and UFOs were appearing almost everywhere. And today, the sightings continue, as well as the interest in the subject. I can guarantee you that if you were to go into almost any newsagent's today and take just a cursory glance at the publications on offer you would see magazines on UFOs and aliens.\n\nBut although there is a lot of current interest and alleged sightings, the phenomenon is by no means a new one. Throughout history strange objects and lights have appeared in the sky. The video 'UFOs: The Hidden Truth' makes these observations:\n\n\n   American presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagen have spoken of seeing UFOs.\n\nAnd the list goes on: astronauts, radar specialists, policemen, FBI agents. Are we really to believe that all these people are actually liars? I don't think that it is really fair to say that all of these people are lying. However, about 90 percent of the reported sightings can be explained without seeing little green men around every corner. But we are still left with a percentage that remain as a mystery.\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
