This new volume offers selections from a wide variety of Steiners published works, presenting a broad, accessible overview of Anthroposophy. In his introduction, McDermott recounts Steiners life and work, from his childhood and education to his work as a natural scientist, philosopher, scholar, educator, artist, interpreter of culture, and seer. He places Steiner in relation to major traditions of thought and explores the genesis and development of Anthroposophy.
