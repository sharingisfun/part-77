There's only one problem; you don't have enough fuel and you need the power of stars to keep it going. \n\nEvery time you hit a star you'll get a boost that tosses you in the direction you choose, but the ship will crash fast if you don't manage to get to the next star.\nThe controls are easy to master, but the game is a real challange. \n\nNot only do you have to catch all the stars, you have to watch out for supernovas and black holes that will kill you unless you learn how to use them correctly. The black hole has a force field that, when used correctly, will help you finish the level.\n\nYou control the spaceship only using your thumbs, no buttons or hard-to-understand controls.\nWith more than 70 levels, two worlds and over one hour active game time, this game will keep you both busy and entertained.\n\nFeatures:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œUnique art and music, space as you never experienced it before!\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œChallenging puzzles.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œFast paced gameplay, you have to think fast!\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œMore than 70 levels and over an hour active game time.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œTwo interesting worlds.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Time for takeoff, time to go to space!\nStarCaptain was the winner of Game Concept Challange 2012.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n1.09\nPerformance updates\nMore devices supported\n1.2\nThree graphical settings\nPractice mode added\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NumberTwentyFiveEntertainments.StarCaptain&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NumberTwentyFiveEntertainments.StarCaptain&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5018f1bd367eb14364ea75380b9fcb60878c00cc","amp;dn":"StarCaptain+v1.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5018f1bd367eb14364ea75380b9fcb60878c00cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,24,241,189,54,126,177,67,100,234,117,56,11,159,203,96,135,140,0,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
