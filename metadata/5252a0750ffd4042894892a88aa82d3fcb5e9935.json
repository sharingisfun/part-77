With billions of dollars supplied by Medicare, the only barrier to profit is how little service is provided to the senior citizens trapped in a very, poorly regulated industry which is usually neglected by state governments and their corrupt bureaucrats.\n\nFault Lines looks at individual cases which  should be classed as criminal neglect but because of a very, thin line of inspection and criminal investigation, the operators of nursing homes get away the poorest service, resulting in the horrible deaths and widespread mistreatment of residents. \n\nVery lucrative and ever sensitive to accusations, the industry has cloaked itself in a complex tangle of  ownership which is almost impossible to penetrate while the investment honchos running this scheme profits immensely.  \n\nMeanwhile, people who expect to live their final days in dignity die in misery, often alone, or with relatives so horrified by what happened, they can bear to look at how their loved ones died. \n\n\n(Unofficial information) \n\nFLV: \nshunster ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5252a0750ffd4042894892a88aa82d3fcb5e9935","amp;dn":"Elderly+Incorporated%7E+2013+09+Fault+Lines+Al+Jazeera+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5252a0750ffd4042894892a88aa82d3fcb5e9935","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,82,160,117,15,253,64,66,137,72,146,168,138,168,45,63,203,94,153,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
