They arrived late and to be honest I could not ask them to close the - already long - row. So I had the reshuffle the row a bit, to reassign a more logical place. No one expects to find Simon &amp; Garfunkel at the bottom.\n\nA lot of work. However, music is a living thing and so some of the other portraits had already undergone some make over. And ordered in five more or less matching rows, it all makes more sense now. So its not too bad to download it again.\n\nAt the other hand, you cannot keep maintaining things for ever. Sometimes its time for something new. So this must be really it. A kind of sketch of old and new Pop Music in 75 Portraits (about 10% I portrayed). All in the best MP3 (unfortunately?) tracks I could find and all ordered (so you can play it as a real Playlist).\n\nDon't be angry if your favorite Band or Song is missing (You are free to add and delete if you wish. If I could, I would have done that already.). I just tried to relive all performed songs as if I would play and sing it myself.\n\nThe songs in which I could radiate the most energy and I was quite sure the original artists would like to be portrayed (Sound), I selected. And ordered the songs like a personal concert, valid for as many people as possible.\n\nI hope the Artists and You can appreciate it.... Enjoy (and listen to these girls and boys; they really have something to say)\n\nPS: I still looking for the two last candidates for my Exceptional Misfits series. Three I have already: Mike Old Field, N.E.R.D. and Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson. Suggestions? ABBA?\n\n\nDutch Treat B021-025 (5 Leading Indie Artists)\n\nB021 Soldier (Angus &amp; Julia Stone)\n\n 01 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Mango Tree\n 02 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Here We Go Again\n 03 Angus Stone - Bird On The Buffalo\n 04 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - What You Wanted\n 05 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Paper Aeroplane\n 06 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Big Jet Plane\n 07 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Private Lawns\n 08 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Soldier\n 09 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Say It Right\n 10 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Stranger\n 11 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Yellow Brick Road\n 12 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - For You\n 13 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Draw Your Swords\n 14 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - And The Boys\n 15 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Babylon\n 16 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - The Beast\n 17 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Bella\n 18 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Hush\n 19 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - A Book Like This\n 20 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - The Devil's Tears\n 21 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Jewels And Gold\n 22 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - All Of Me\n 23 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Just A Boy\n 24 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Silver Coin\n 25 Angus &amp; Julia Stone - Horse And Cart\n\nB022 Life Is Wonderful (Jason Mraz)\n\n 01 Jason Mraz - 93 Million Miles\n 02 Jason Mraz - The Freedom Song\n 03 Jason Mraz - Butterfly\n 04 Jason Mraz - Did You Get My Message\n 05 Jason Mraz - Bella Luna\n 06 Jason Mraz - The Dynamo Of Volition (From An All Night Session)\n 07 Jason Mraz - 56\n 08 Jason Mraz - Common Pleasure\n 09 Jason Mraz - 0% Interest\n 10 Jason Mraz - Geek In The Pink\n 11 Jason Mraz - Clockwatching\n 12 Jason Mraz &amp; Raul MidÃ‚Â¢n - Keep On Hoping\n 13 Jason Mraz - Life Is Wonderful\n 14 Jason Mraz - Childlike Wildlife\n 15 Jason Mraz - You And I Both (A)\n 16 Jason Mraz - The Woman I Love\n 17 Jason Mraz - I Won't Give Up\n 18 Jason Mraz - Mr. Curiosity\n 19 Jason Mraz &amp; Colbie Caillat - Lucky\n 20 Jason Mraz - I'm Yours\n 21 Jason Mraz - Live High (L)\n 22 Jason Mraz - If It Kills Me (L)\n 23 Jason Mraz - Wordplay (L)\n 24 Jason Mraz - The Beauty In Ugly (A)\n 25 Jason Mraz - God Rests In Reason (L)\n 26 Jason Mraz - Make It Mine (A)\n 27 Jason Mraz - Sleeping To Dream (L)\n 28 Jason Mraz - Love For A Child (A)\n 29 Jason Mraz - On Love, In Sadness (L)\n 30 Jason Mraz - A Beautiful Mess (A)\n 31 Jason Mraz - No Doubling Back (L)\n 32 Jason Mraz - Song For A Friend (L)\n 33 Jason Mraz - 10,000 Motherfuckers (L)\n\nB023 Promise (Ben Howard)\n\n 01 Ben Howard - Everything\n 02 Ben Howard - Bones\n 03 Ben Howard - Black Flies\n 04 Ben Howard - Old Pine\n 05 Ben Howard - Oats In The Water\n 06 Ben Howard - Only Love\n 07 Ben Howard - The Fear\n 08 Ben Howard - Further Away\n 09 Ben Howard - Keep Your Head Up\n 10 Ben Howard - Three Tree Town\n 11 Ben Howard - Follaton Wood\n 12 Ben Howard - The Wolves\n 13 Ben Howard - Esmerelda\n 14 Ben Howard - Promise\n\nB024 Wake Me Up (Ed Sheeran)\n\n 01 Ed Sheeran - Autumn Leaves\n 02 Ed Sheeran - Be Like You\n 03 Ed Sheeran - The City\n 04 Ed Sheeran - Sunburn\n 05 Ed Sheeran - Homeless (A)\n 06 Ed Sheeran - Cold Coffee\n 07 Ed Sheeran - Fire Alarms\n 08 Ed Sheeran - Little Bird\n 09 Ed Sheeran - Lego House (A)\n 10 Ed Sheeran - Drunk\n 11 Ed Sheeran - U.N.I\n 12 Ed Sheeran - Gold Rush\n 13 Ed Sheeran - Give Me Love\n 14 Ed Sheeran - This\n 15 Ed Sheeran - Let It Out (A)\n 16 Ed Sheeran - One Night\n 17 Ed Sheeran - Small Bump\n 18 Ed Sheeran - Firefly (A)\n 19 Ed Sheeran - She\n 20 Ed Sheeran - Kiss Me (A)\n 21 Ed Sheeran - The A Team\n 22 Ed Sheeran - Wonderwall (A)\n 23 Ed Sheeran - Grade 8 (A)\n 24 Ed Sheeran - Fall\n 25 Ed Sheeran - Youneedme (A)\n 26 Ed Sheeran - Nightmares (Ft.
