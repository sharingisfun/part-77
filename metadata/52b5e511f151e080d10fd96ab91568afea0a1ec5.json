This sample bank offers you ground-shaking hits, both natural performances, such as gran casa a deux, as well as stacked and processed hits. Words can only describe so much, so listen to the demos to know exactly what we mean by &quot;ground-shaking&quot;. If you are working on a powerful action cue, True Strike 2's Big Bangs are your main ingredient.\n\nWorld Percussion\nFor True Strike 2, over 52 individual world percussion instruments have been sampled, covering the following regions: Japanese / Asian, African and European / Turkish. You will find okedo (taiko) drums, doundoun, udu, gomee, brekete, darabukas, bowls, bendirs, chappa from various regions, atarigane, kangagui bells and cajon. For all main instruments various idiomatic phrases are available. All world instruments have been recorded in studio or stage environments and are available in two microphone sets: close and room. Please note that the &quot;Hear a Sample&quot; MP3 above was performed using single hit samples only. No loops or phrases were used!\n\nBowed metal\nTrue Strike 2 gives you bone-chilling recordings of bowed cymbal, china, vibraphone and crotales. Recorded in a concert hall, you get to choose between an agressive, direct sound that you can process yourself, or an ambient, distant sound that will fit into your suspense cue right away.\n\nPrepared piano\nOne of True Strike 2's special features is the prepared concert grand piano. Recorded in an ambient concert hall using 3 mic positions, this set includes plucked snares, both sustained and dampened struck snares and a barrage of prepared piano effects such as glissandi, clusters, brush hits, wooden hits, hand-struck hits and much more.\n\nDystopian effects\nTrue Strike 2 does not only focus on acoustic sounds. The library comes with an impressive set of sound-designed and processed effects. Over two 88-note keyboards worth of otherworldly hits, scapes and spheres are at your disposal. These are unique and instantly inspiring sounds that you will start using from day one.\n\nCimbalom\nThis library holds one big melodic bonus for you: a fully sampled, 3 GB cimbalom recorded in 3 velocities with 4 alternates for every single stroke, sustained and dampened notes as well as tremolo, slap and special effects.
