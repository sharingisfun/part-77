The two issues collected work from horror artist, Ralph Reese.\n\nThank you creative teams and scanners! Procure it, provide it!\n\n\n\nPart deus of this Eclipse 2-for-1 (sponsored by ScoutMob) is another Peter Milligan series, &quot;Johnny Nemo Magazine&quot;! This three-issue mini was published in 1985-86 and, like Strange Days, reprinted material Milligan did for Brit comics, with Bret Ewins handling the art chores. LeonardTSpock again is the uploader, and he did so in August of 2012.
