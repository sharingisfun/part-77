I tried to make this as much Ã¢â‚¬Å“hands onÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as possible, placing example codes everywhere it fit. Also I tried to insert as many picture as possible, because they liven up the learning process and relax the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes. But unfortunately coding is not everything; one has to learn about some basic facts of the Android Platform to fully understand. That is what is described on the first ~XXX pages. It is not necessary to read all those describing pages, but it is preferable. You could decide to treat it as a kind of reference. What you would read there is also explained when it occurs during the Ã¢â‚¬Å“hands onÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½-process. So you could directly start at Hello World Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Android Way.\n\nBook Details :\n\nTitle : android programming -  andbook.pdf \nSize : 1.74 Mb\nPages : 62\nLanguage : English\nFormat : pdf\n\nFollow us on facebook....\n\nhttp:// www. facebook .com/ torrentsharing\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55064bef8adaedca6c9ace929cbf76255408e379","amp;dn":"android+programming+-+%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+torrents+andbook.pdf+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55064bef8adaedca6c9ace929cbf76255408e379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,6,75,239,138,218,237,202,108,154,206,146,156,191,118,37,84,8,227,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
