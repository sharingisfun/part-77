However, his most important collection of prophetic verses has remained hidden...until now.\n\nIn the year 2009, a letter was mailed to a woman who does not understand why she has received the puzzling correspondence, written in a series of codes and ancient languages. She enlists the help of Jonathon Payne and David Jones.\n\nRelentlessly hunted by those determined to protect the secret, the duo has no choice but to fight back. In an adventure that spans two continents and several centuries, Payne and Jones must locate the sacred text that may change everything we know about the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56ba65d7da499c2f951fa0ba71852ee7f8c2d0cb","amp;dn":"The+Prophecy+-+Chris+Kuzneski.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56ba65d7da499c2f951fa0ba71852ee7f8c2d0cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,186,101,215,218,73,156,47,149,31,160,186,113,133,46,231,248,194,208,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
