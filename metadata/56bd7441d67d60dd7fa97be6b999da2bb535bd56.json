Capital Police. \n\nInvestment broker and financial commentator Peter Schiff joins the show to reveal that the Federal Reserve's monetary expansion program, called Quantitative Easing, is destroying the middle class and pushing the American economy towards a cliff under the illusion of an economic recovery. \n\nAlex also invites author and social analyst Mark Dice on the show to talk about his latest video showcasing Obama supporters who do not even know the president is a Democrat. \n\nAdditionally, author and psychological warfare expert Dr. Steve Pieczenik joins the broadcast to speak on the recent shooting in D.C. and the current state of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
