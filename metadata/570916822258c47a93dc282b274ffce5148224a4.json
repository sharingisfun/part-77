He covered his face because he had a sadistic father who burned his face. Everybody makes jokes about his scars and when the new boss fired him, he go to an old swamp-witch who gives him a peace of wood from a hanging tree and Wilbur makes a mask from this piece of wood and put all his anger in this mask. When he puts the mask on, everybody who looks on this mask commits suicide. He has created the Death-Mask.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:570916822258c47a93dc282b274ffce5148224a4","amp;dn":"Death+Mask+%281998%2C+Eng%29+SATRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"570916822258c47a93dc282b274ffce5148224a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,9,22,130,34,88,196,122,147,220,40,43,39,79,252,229,20,130,36,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
