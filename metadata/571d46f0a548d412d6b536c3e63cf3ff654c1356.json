The band formed in the summer of 1991 when singer/songwriter Ben Friedman and lead guitar player Jimmy &quot;Lownote&quot; Lavender began to work on songs together as both shared a love for the 1950s blues/country sound (now called rockabilly music). Ben's childhood friend, drummer Frances &quot;Fast Pedal' Farran was enlisted to play the drums. Many nights were spent practicing in &quot;Fast Pedal&quot; Farran's shed. Friend and guitarist Rob Fickling was asked to switch to Bass guitar and the first incarnation of CSI was born.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:571d46f0a548d412d6b536c3e63cf3ff654c1356","amp;dn":"Cigar+Store+Indians+-+Cigar+Store+Indians","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"571d46f0a548d412d6b536c3e63cf3ff654c1356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,29,70,240,165,72,212,18,214,181,54,195,230,60,243,255,101,76,19,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
