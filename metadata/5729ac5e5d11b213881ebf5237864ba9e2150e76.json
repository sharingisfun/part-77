All the extra crap that M. Night thought he needed to have in the movie was removed. Only the parts essential the the story and most action sequences have been left in. One scene (Cypher Rage checking his leg) was reordered for story correctness. \nI like this version of the movie better than the long drawn out boring version that M. Night decieded to release. \nTwo people that should STOP be allowed to make movies: M. Night and JJ Abrams. Actually JJ Abrams is pretty good if he could put down the fucking flashlight. Lost was great.\n \nAnyway. on with the show!\nLet me know what you think in the comments!\n\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5729ac5e5d11b213881ebf5237864ba9e2150e76","amp;dn":"After.Earth.2013.In.Under.30.Min.LoRes.h264-REVV9K+-+Copy.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5729ac5e5d11b213881ebf5237864ba9e2150e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,41,172,94,93,17,178,19,136,30,191,82,55,134,75,169,226,21,14,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
