THE MEDICI DAGGER Hollywood stuntman Reb Barnett lives on the edge to avoid the nightmares of his past -- until an anonymous phone call pulls him from his world of cinematic illusion and sends him to Italy on a desperate quest where danger and violence are chillingly real. Reb seeks Leonard da Vinci's Circles of Truth, a coded fifteenth century map that will lead him to the Medici Dagger,an ingenious but lethal invention -- a weapon so light and indestructible it's worth a fortune to arms manufacturers. To Reb, the dagger is his only link to his father's suspicious death years ago. But breaking the code means matching wits with Leonardo. And staying alive means evading the killer who haunts Reb's dreams. Cameron West's pulse-pounding debut novel is fueled with intellectual twists and the roller-coaster thrills of the great classic adventure stories.\n\n    ISBN13: 9781416501619\n    ISBN10: 1416501614\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:575c2ab6f752703267c317510e1ad66b750bce17","amp;dn":"Cameron+West%2C+The+Medici+Dagger+epub+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"575c2ab6f752703267c317510e1ad66b750bce17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,92,42,182,247,82,112,50,103,195,23,81,14,26,214,107,117,11,206,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
