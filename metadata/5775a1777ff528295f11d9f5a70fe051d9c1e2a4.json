Since I have no idea when I'll actually get around to fully learning Mandarin, I figured I should try to hack an English sub track (sorry international bros/sis's, if I were less ignorant and knew more languauges I'd do them too).  After spending hours doing this for myself I figured anyone else that might want it for their blu-ray could benefit too (extract video and audio tracks as desired and repackage with subs).  I'm sorta providing it as-is, but feel free to give feedback (especially broken stuff, it works for me but who knows), and if I get a chance to breathe I'll see if I can do more work on it...for ex. the many cases of joined dialog ie. one subtitle holding dialog between multiple cast members.  Another option is to use an .srt editor like SubtitleEdit, feel free.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5775a1777ff528295f11d9f5a70fe051d9c1e2a4","amp;dn":"English+subtitles+for+Snake+and+Crane+Arts+of+Shaolin+Blu-ray+Re","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5775a1777ff528295f11d9f5a70fe051d9c1e2a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,117,161,119,127,245,40,41,95,17,217,245,167,15,224,81,217,193,226,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
