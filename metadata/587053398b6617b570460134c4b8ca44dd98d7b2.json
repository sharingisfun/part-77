At the head of the company are married couple John and Anne Armstrong who run the business with the rather down-to-earth madness that you tend to find in English SME's! Sales are down though and things do not look good. The sales team are about as demotivated and as ineffective as you could imagine and, with no new customers coming in, the manufacturing staff have nothing to make and things are looking bleak. This documentary series follows the pair as they manage their business.\n\nIt doesn't sound like a comedy but let me assure you that my plot summary does not in any way manage to convey the sheer, jaw-dropping wonderfulness of this series. Essentially it is like a SME (Small to Medium Enterprise) version of The Office.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:587053398b6617b570460134c4b8ca44dd98d7b2","amp;dn":"The+Armstrongs+%282006%29+UK+Tv+series+Ep2%28Rare%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"587053398b6617b570460134c4b8ca44dd98d7b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,112,83,57,139,102,23,181,112,70,1,52,196,184,202,68,221,152,215,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
