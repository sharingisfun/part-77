They arrived late and to be honest I could not ask them to close the - already long - row. So I had the reshuffle the row a bit, to reassign a more logical place. No one expects to find Simon &amp; Garfunkel at the bottom.\n\nA lot of work. However, music is a living thing and so some of the other portraits had already undergone some make over. And ordered in five more or less matching rows, it all makes more sense now. So its not too bad to download it again.\n\nAt the other hand, you cannot keep maintaining things for ever. Sometimes its time for something new. So this must be really it. A kind of sketch of old and new Pop Music in 75 Portraits (about 10% I portrayed). All in the best MP3 (unfortunately?) tracks I could find and all ordered (so you can play it as a real Playlist).\n\nDon't be angry if your favorite Band or Song is missing (You are free to add and delete if you wish. If I could, I would have done that already.). I just tried to relive all performed songs as if I would play and sing it myself.\n\nThe songs in which I could radiate the most energy and I was quite sure the original artists would like to be portrayed (Sound), I selected. And ordered the songs like a personal concert, valid for as many people as possible.\n\nI hope the Artists and You can appreciate it.... Enjoy (and listen to these girls and boys; they really have something to say)\n\nPS: I still looking for the two last candidates for my Exceptional Misfits series. Three I have already: Mike Old Field, N.E.R.D. and Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson. Suggestions? ABBA?\n\n\nDutch Treat B006-010 (5 Leading Artists)\n\nB006 Hallo Spaceboy (David Bowie)\n\n 01 David Bowie - Hallo Spaceboy (Pet Shop Boys Remix)\n 02 David Bowie - Life On Mars\n 03 David Bowie - Rock 'N' Roll Suicide\n 04 David Bowie - Time\n 05 David Bowie - Five Years\n 06 David Bowie - Space Oddity\n 07 David Bowie - Wild Is The Wind\n 08 David Bowie - Soul Love\n 09 David Bowie - Drive-In Sunday\n 10 David Bowie - Changes\n 11 David Bowie &amp; Pat Metheny Group - This Is Not America\n 12 David Bowie - Ashes To Ashes\n 13 David Bowie - Young Americans\n 14 David Bowie - China Girl\n 15 David Bowie - Days\n 16 David Bowie - Golden Years\n 17 David Bowie - Under Pressure (With Queen)\n 18 David Bowie - Dancing In The Street (With Mick Jagger)\n 19 David Bowie - Let's Dance\n 20 David Bowie - Absolute Beginners\n 21 David Bowie - Heroes\n 22 David Bowie - Ziggy Stardust\n 23 David Bowie - Fame\n 24 David Bowie - Sound And Vision (L)\n 25 David Bowie - The Jean Genie\n 26 David Bowie - Rebel Rebel\n 27 David Bowie &amp; Tina Turner - Tonight (Live)\n\nB007 Rock With You (Michael Jackson)\n\n 01 Michael Jackson - Beat It\n 02 Michael Jackson - Ben\n 03 Michael Jackson - Heal The World\n 04 Michael Jackson - We Are The World (Demo)\n 05 Michael Jackson - Whatever Happens (Ft.
