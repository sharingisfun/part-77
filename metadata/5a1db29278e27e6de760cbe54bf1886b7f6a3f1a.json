For years, Kuklinski gains a reputation for cold blooded professionalism even as he raises a family who are kept in the dark about his true career. Unfortunately, mob politics ultimately forces him to secretly work independently with the psychopathic Robert Ã¢â‚¬ËœMr. FreezyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Pronge. As much as Kuklinski tries to keep his lives separate, circumstances and his own weaknesses threaten a terrible collision as the consequences of his choices finally catch up to him.\n\nThe Iceman 2012 LIMITED BDRip X264 GECKOS\n\nGenre: Biography | Crime | Drama | Thriller\nIMDB Rating: 7.0/10 from 3,400 users Metascore: 60/100\nDirected by: Ariel Vromen\nStarring: Michael Shannon, Winona Ryder, Chris Evans\n\nRelease Name: The.Iceman.2012.LIMITED.BDRip.X264-GECKOS\nSize: 546MB\nVideo: MKV | 720Ãƒâ€”406\nAudio: English | AAC | 48.0 KHz\nRuntime: 1h 45mn\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a1db29278e27e6de760cbe54bf1886b7f6a3f1a","amp;dn":"+The+Iceman+2012+LIMITED+BDRip+X264-GECKOS+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a1db29278e27e6de760cbe54bf1886b7f6a3f1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,29,178,146,120,226,126,109,231,96,203,229,75,241,136,107,127,106,63,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
