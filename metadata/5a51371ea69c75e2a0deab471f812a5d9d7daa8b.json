It's still mining the same folky Celtic vein that won the band a number of fans the first two times out, but better focus this time makes the album more enjoyable through repeated listens. &quot;1000 Goodbyes&quot; explores touring's effect on relationships. &quot;Gotohell&quot; is a lovely little kiss-off for that jerk everyone knows. And with mentions of Saskatoon, Rita MacNeil, hockey, and a frozen car engine, I challenge anyone to find a more Canadian song than &quot;Frozen Puck to the Head,&quot; which is easily the funniest and best song on the album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a51371ea69c75e2a0deab471f812a5d9d7daa8b","amp;dn":"Captain+Tractor+-+Bought+the+Farm+%5B1997%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a51371ea69c75e2a0deab471f812a5d9d7daa8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,81,55,30,166,156,117,226,160,222,171,71,31,129,42,93,157,125,170,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
