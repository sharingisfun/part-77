He is an orphan boy brought up in the church by a righteous parish priest who guided him towards goodness and faith upon the Lord Jesus Christ, who eventually referred as Bossing by Juan. But because he had an innate temper, the pruddish townspeople disliked him except the priest whom he regarded as his father. One day, the priest was killed by a thief. Juan ended up in the streets of Quiapo, as a simple, kind and yet tough young man. Unknown to him, he is half-aswang, the son of the Haring Aswang (King of Aswang) and also the prophesied Anak ng Dilim (Child of Darkness). He is fated to rule over his kind and take over the human race. But his mother is a Tagabantay (Guardian), coming from an ancient lineage of defenders using the Bakal na Krus (Iron Cross) to destroy the Aswangs.\nHow can Juan fulfill his destiny as the next Tagabantay while struggling against his nature as an Aswang Ã¢â‚¬â€ a creature he is also destined to destroy? This is the story of the fight between good and evil that also happens inside all of us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b4aeb436fc9314b7daa158c33e09e5db8e4da22","amp;dn":"Juan+Dela+Cruz+Episodes+61-103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b4aeb436fc9314b7daa158c33e09e5db8e4da22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,74,235,67,111,201,49,75,125,170,21,140,51,224,158,93,184,228,218,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
