This is the latest as of Jan 2013.  I am uploading this as a torrent as i am sure there are plenty of people that would like to restore or upgrade their phone, but hate using hotfile.\n\nso please use, i hope it improves your phone.  I will seed this until there's at least ten fairly permanent seeders.  \n\nyou will need either Kies, or Odin to install this on your phone.  There are tonnes of guides available. \n\nEnjoy\n\n\n\n1337 characters and wordz with lotz of zzzz in it..  \t\n\nSorry for the double post, I didn't include any trackers on the last one.
