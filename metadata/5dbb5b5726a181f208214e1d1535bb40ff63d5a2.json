We'll also analyze the use of the shutdown as political leverage and as a Republican-demonization tool, and reports regarding the recent capture of an Al Qaeda operative. \n\nOn today's show, Alex welcomes Michael Boldin, the founder and Executive Director of the Tenth Amendment Center, to examine the passage of California Assembly Bill 351, which essentially nullifies the NDAA's indefinite detention clause. \n\nAlex also invites tech industry wizard John McAfee to discuss the development of his new NSA-thwarting gadget, as well as the potential security and identity theft risks built-in to Obamacare.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
