It was devised by Chris Boucher, a writer who had previously worked on the science fiction television series Doctor Who and Blake's 7 as well as crime dramas such as Juliet Bravo and Bergerac. Set in the year 2027, a time where Interplanetary travel has become commonplace, it starred David Calder as Nathan Spring, commander of the International Space Police ForceÃ¢â‚¬â€nicknamed the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Star Cops&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€who provide law enforcement for the newly developing colonies of the Solar System. The series follows Spring and the rest of his multinational team as they work to establish the Star Cops and solve whatever crimes come their way. Operating in a relatively accurately realised hard SF, near-future, space environment, many of the cases that the Star Cops investigate arise from opportunities for new crimes presented by the technologically advanced future society the series depicts and from the hostile frontier nature of the environment that the Star Cops live in.\n\nIn total nine episodes of Star Cops were made. A tenth episode, titled &quot;Death on the Moon&quot;, was planned but industrial relations difficulties during production led to it being abandoned shortly before recording was to commence\n\nThanks to TheBox.bz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e6ea403da0a50875a0f3b31e2ddcac301122f46","amp;dn":"Starcops+1987","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e6ea403da0a50875a0f3b31e2ddcac301122f46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,110,164,3,218,10,80,135,90,15,59,49,226,221,202,195,1,18,47,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
