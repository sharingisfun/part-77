(short for We Hate Everything All the Time) set out some 13-14 years ago to be the most unlistenable, offensive band ever to exist, and to this day not one record executive has asked the band to sign a contract.  Mission accomplished!\n\nBoasting under 20 likes on Facebook, even W.H.E.A.T.'s personal friends are unwilling to lend their support!  When the band members play their &quot;songs&quot; to their friends and loved ones, they become visibly uncomfortable, and have difficulty paying attention to the songs for more than 10 seconds.  Generally, when a W.H.E.A.T. song comes on, people try to change the subject as fast as possible!\n\nSo if you hate music, and everything else, and wish to make your friends and acquaintances severely uncomfortable, or if you want to drive your neighbors away, simply download this torrent and play at full volume!  It's that easy!\n\nThis torrent features W.H.E.A.T.'s complete discography from 2001-2008.  More &quot;music&quot; is in the making, so watch out for that, as it will be made available to download as soon as it's completed.\n\nDiscography includes:\n\nI Hear Instruments, But That's Not Music\nThe Microphone Off Sessions\nLegends Of Tales, Many Ages Past\nTo The Maxxx, With Power and Suckulence! (E.P.)\nTaste The Rainbow (With Your Butthole)\nSatire Doesn't Seem Like The Right Word When You've Taken It This Far\nUnicorn Powerhouse\nNo One Does What We Do. No One Can.
