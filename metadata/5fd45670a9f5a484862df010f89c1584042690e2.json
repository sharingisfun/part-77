The first show he crashes, though, is across the state line in Topeka, Kansas where Larry gets in on the action at a prestigious dog show. His trip takes a detour in the small town of Lebanon where he invades a local caf and learns the art of chicken sexing from an unlikely local. Finally, Larry and the crew hit historic Branson where Larry bounces from the Baldknobbers to the Three Redneck Tenors before meeting the one entertainer who loves America as much as Larry does: the Russian Cold War comic, Yakov Smirnoff.\n\n\nGOD BLESS YAKOV he's a real American!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fd45670a9f5a484862df010f89c1584042690e2","amp;dn":"Only+in+America+with+Larry+the+Cable+Guy+S03E14+Larry+Squeezes+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fd45670a9f5a484862df010f89c1584042690e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,212,86,112,169,245,164,132,134,45,240,16,248,156,21,132,4,38,144,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
