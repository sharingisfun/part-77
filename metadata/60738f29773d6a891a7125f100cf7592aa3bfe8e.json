Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL License.\n\nWhy another Flash Media Server? we are a little software/website development team. we decided that we will do something in streaming, so we developed very small and portable but power-full rtmp server. On the 25th November 2003 it was made available on Sourceforge, and that was the birth of Anymix Interactive Server.\nHow to install:\n\nFrom the zip : just unzip all the files into a directory you want then launch it. Its a portable and little FMS.\nHow to Use:\n\nTo Lunch server: use a batch file or command prompt : pathanymixrtmp.exe serveraddress port authorsite*\nex: anymixrtmp.exe localhost 1935 www.anymixmedia.com\nNow the client can connect to rtmp://server:1935/myapp or rtmp://server/someapp and will get connected to this MyApp application.\nTo stop server run &quot;server-shutdown.exe&quot; once.\nWeb sites:\n\nAnymix Media Server official site: http://www.anymixmedia.com/\nAnymix Media Server project site: http://sourceforge.net/projects/anymixrtmp/\nLike us\nfollow us on twitter:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60738f29773d6a891a7125f100cf7592aa3bfe8e","amp;dn":"Anymix_Media_Server_v2.0.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60738f29773d6a891a7125f100cf7592aa3bfe8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,115,143,41,119,61,106,137,26,113,37,241,0,207,117,146,170,59,254,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
