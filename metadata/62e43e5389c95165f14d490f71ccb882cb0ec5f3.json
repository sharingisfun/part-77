To scientists, the supertwister held sobering lessons about the future for rapidly expanding cities in tornado-threatened areas. Most tornadoes form suddenly and with little warning. But now meteorologists are on the verge of a breakthrough that may solve the puzzle of how these killer storms spawn and where they are likely to strike. NOVA follows stormchasers as they probe the tornado's deadly secrets.&quot;\n\nFile: PBS.Nova.-.S31E15.-.Hunt.for.the.Supertwister (256MB, 56:15)\nResolution: 720x368 (native DVD), 16:9 aspect ratio\nAudio: AAC 48kHz 128kb/s stereo\nVideo: H-264 MPEG-4, 29.97fps\nSubtitles: English CC\nEncoding: Handbrake, RF=25\nOriginally broadcast: 2004-Mar.-30\n\nNotes:\n\n- Wikipedia calls this episode S31E07 (all of their episode numbers seem to differ from here.)\n\n- Already posted here ( https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8507039/PBS_NOVA_2004_Hunt_for_the_Supertwister_720p_x264_AAC_MVGroup.or ) but is 1.23GB, so for those with last bandwidth, here's a good quality copy about a fifth of the size.\n\n- The aspect ratio and resolution of the original DVD source were non-standard/letterboxed. I cropped out most of the letterboxing. The black bar at the bottom isn't erroneous; it is due to the program's overlays extending into the letterboxing so enough was left that they were not lost.\n\nPlease seed to 100% or higher so that this torrent doesn't go the way of the others. My upstream isn't the fastest (max. about 50kBps) so be patient and you'll get your file.\nIf everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62e43e5389c95165f14d490f71ccb882cb0ec5f3","amp;dn":"PBS+Nova+-+S31E15+-+Hunt+for+the+Supertwister","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62e43e5389c95165f14d490f71ccb882cb0ec5f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,228,62,83,137,201,81,101,241,77,73,15,113,204,184,130,203,14,197,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
