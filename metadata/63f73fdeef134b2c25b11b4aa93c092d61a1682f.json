When Jane refuses to marry one of the Mormon elders and instead befriends Venters, a young Gentile rider, the Mormons begin to persecute her openly. Meanwhile, Lassiter, a notorious gunman, arrives at the Withersteen ranch in search of the grave of his long-lost sister, and stays on as Jane's defender while Venters is on the trail of a gang of rustlers that includes a mysterious Masked Rider.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: Zane Grey\nPublished: 1912\nLanguage: English\nWordcount: 101,753 / 291 pg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63f73fdeef134b2c25b11b4aa93c092d61a1682f","amp;dn":"Riders+of+the+Purple+Sage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63f73fdeef134b2c25b11b4aa93c092d61a1682f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,247,63,222,239,19,75,44,37,177,27,74,169,60,9,45,97,161,104,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
