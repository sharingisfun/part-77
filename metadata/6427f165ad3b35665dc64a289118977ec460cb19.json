(Sea, Eugene, Shoo), (Hangul: Ã¬â€”ï¿½Ã¬Å Â¤.Ã¬ï¿½Â´.Ã¬â€”ï¿½Ã¬Å Â¤) was a South Korean girl group under the management of SM Entertainment. Lasting from 1997 to 2002, they were viewed as the female version of H.O.T., another SM group who also enjoyed phenomenal popularity during the same years.\n\nS.E.S. was K-pop's first highly successful girl group. They were challenged by groups like Fin.K.L (Hangul: Ã­â€¢â€˜Ã­ï¿½Â´) and Baby V.O.X (Hangul: Ã«Â²Â Ã¬ï¿½Â´Ã«Â¹â€žÃ«Â³ÂµÃ¬Å Â¤) debuted soon after S.E.S. and were also successful. Although an intense rivalry developed between S.E.S. and Fin.K.L fans, members of both groups have always stated that there was no rivalry and that they in fact were friends. However, while S.E.S. managed to consistently have high sales numbers for their albums, it was Fin.K.L who won a daesang (Ã«Å’â‚¬Ã¬Æ’ï¿½) (the Korean equivalent of the Grammy Award) for &quot;Artist of the Year&quot;, from various music award shows.\n\nThrough the years, the members have gone through various style and image changes, from cute to sexy to mature, without losing their strong fanbase. S.E.S. broke up at the end of 2002, and its members have gone solo to varying degrees of success.\n\nFLAC 44kHZ ~1kbps bit rate\n\n\nAlbums:\n1997 - S.E.S\n1998 - Sea &amp; Eugene &amp; Shoo\n1999 - Love\n2000 - A Letter from Greenland\n2001 - Surprise\n2002 - Choose My Life-U\n2002 - Friend","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6427f165ad3b35665dc64a289118977ec460cb19","amp;dn":"s.e.s.+lossless+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6427f165ad3b35665dc64a289118977ec460cb19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,39,241,101,173,59,53,102,93,198,74,40,145,24,151,126,196,96,203,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
