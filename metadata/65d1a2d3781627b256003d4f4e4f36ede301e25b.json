The LP was in decent but not pristine condition; a few ticks and pops here and there. AFAIK, the vinyl is out of print. A CD of the recording was released in 2005 but seems hard to find. \n\nA review from People magazine, April 13, 1987: \n\n&quot;It's a mark of the genius of Weill's music that it thrives under such varying interpretations, from the rock star collection issued in 1985 to this far more formal set. The Toronto-born Turofsky, 44, is an opera-trained soprano and recorded this album with the Toronto Chamber Ensemble, so the jazz-inspired components of Weill's songs are subdued. Not that Turofsky is stuffy; she never sounds like an opera star singing down to a pop audience. She also chose a satisfying assortment of songs. They range from the familiar September Song, My Ship and Lost in the Stars to the too often neglected Speak Low, a great love song that Turofsky sings to a Latin beat, and the surprisingly perky (perky for Weill, anyway) Green-up Time. Weill's songs certainly don't need very much filling out when it comes to emotional content, but it's easy to believe that, as Turofsky has said, she sang them with particular feeling. She dedicated the album to her daughter Carrie, who had died in a car crash at 19, not long before recording began. (Fanfare) &quot;\n\nEnjoy. \n\nMC\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65d1a2d3781627b256003d4f4e4f36ede301e25b","amp;dn":"Riki+Turofsky+Sings+Kurt+Weill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65d1a2d3781627b256003d4f4e4f36ede301e25b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,209,162,211,120,22,39,178,86,0,61,79,78,79,54,237,227,1,226,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
