Originally created by the third trimester of 2011 under the name Animus, the band wrote/recorded a couple of demo tracks in the months immediate to its creation. After some time exploring new compositions, on May 2012, Elision Of Animus began writing what would come to be their first press release. It was during this process that the name change occurred, a change made in order to individualize the band further, having in sight an easier access for the listener. \n\nEOA present themselves through Dementia as a flexible unit, combining dynamic Death Metal sections with the energy of Deathcore and the charisma of Progressive Metal. As of this release, it stands clear how seriously EOA take their DIY course of action, having Dementia been entirely composed, recorded and produced by EOA's two constituting members. The band mentions Meshuggah, Cilice, Rings Of Saturn, As I Lay Dying and Veil Of Maya as a few of their major influences. \n\nElision Of Animus are:\nDaniel Pio - Guitars, Bass\nRafael Moreira - Drums, Vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:671c23d98df2918e8d8a22c89e02a9e6a3fd5075","amp;dn":"Elision+Of+Animus+-+Dementia+%282013%29+-+320kbps+Official+Download","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"671c23d98df2918e8d8a22c89e02a9e6a3fd5075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,28,35,217,141,242,145,142,141,138,34,200,158,2,169,230,163,253,80,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
