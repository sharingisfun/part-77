It is one of eight stories in the cycle collected as His Last Bow. Doyle ranked &quot;The Adventure of the Devil's Foot&quot; ninth in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories. Holmes and Dr. Watson find themselves in Cornwall one spring for the formerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health, but the holiday ends with a bizarre event. Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, a local gentleman, and Mr. Roundhay, the local vicar, come to Holmes to report that TregennisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two brothers have gone insane, and his sister has died. Tregennis had gone to visit them in their village (Tredannick Wollas), played whist with them, and then left. When he came back in the morning, he found them still sitting in their places at the table, the brothers, George and Owen, laughing and singing, and the sister, Brenda, dead.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6882c00bbfd69506bbe57e731d439c2b545a98b2","amp;dn":"The+Adventure+of+the+Devil%27s+Foot+by+Sir+Arthur+Conan+Doyle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6882c00bbfd69506bbe57e731d439c2b545a98b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,130,192,11,191,214,149,6,187,229,126,115,29,67,156,43,84,90,152,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
