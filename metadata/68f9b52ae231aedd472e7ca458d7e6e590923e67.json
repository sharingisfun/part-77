Three hundred years later, Counselor Deanna Troi awakens in her quarters from a nightmare in which she senses the voices of the crew of that Russian ship, whose life-essences were somehow absorbed by the creature that destroyed them. And the nightmare heralds a danger to the Enterprise(TM) itself, for if Picard can't discover a way to communicate with the creature, it could absorb his crew just as it did the Russians.\n\nDeleted previous torrent--computer got friend and can't find original files.
