He beautifully describes their lives as students, scholars and members of society. Dr. Hesham will take you along an inspirational journey through the life and genius of Imam Abu Hanifah, the dignity of Imam Malik, the talents of Imam al-Shafi'i and the steadfastness of Imam Ahmad. Dr. Hisham succeeds in presenting the Imams in a manner that allows the listener to relate to them, and consequently benefit from their great lives regardless of whether the listener is--or aspires to be--a scholar or not. According to the Quranic injunctions this is the most important objective of presenting history. This series belongs to a category of Islamic knowledge that is among the most needed: The knowledge that attempts to revive the Muslim identity and connect the Muslims to their rich heritage.\n\nCONTAINS 13 PARTS (CDs)\n\nPLEASE SEED AND HELP OTHERS DOWNLOAD FASTER \nJAZAK ALLAH KHAIR :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6997b06999c912918962a511bd6da2a848b52f8a","amp;dn":"The+Four+Great+Imams+-+Islamic+lecture+series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6997b06999c912918962a511bd6da2a848b52f8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,151,176,105,153,201,18,145,137,98,165,17,189,109,162,168,72,181,47,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
