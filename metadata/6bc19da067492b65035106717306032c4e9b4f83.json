Thanks for AskingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; Ã¢â‚¬Å“And Then I Snuck a Dead Cuban Alligator on an Airplane.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Pictures with captions (no one would believe these things without proof) accompany the text.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bc19da067492b65035106717306032c4e9b4f83","amp;dn":"Let%27s+Pretend+This+Never+Happened+-+Jenny+Lawson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bc19da067492b65035106717306032c4e9b4f83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,193,157,160,103,73,43,101,3,81,6,113,115,6,3,44,78,155,79,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
