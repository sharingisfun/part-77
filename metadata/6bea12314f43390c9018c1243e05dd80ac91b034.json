Featuring LaLonde and drummer Tim &quot;Herb&quot; Alexander, Primus recorded their debut, Suck on This in 1989, followed by four studio albums; Frizzle Fry, Sailing the Seas of Cheese, Pork Soda, and Tales from the Punchbowl. Alexander left the band in 1996, replaced by Bryan &quot;Brain&quot; Mantia, and Primus went on to record the original theme song for the TV show South Park and two more albums, Brown Album and Antipop, before declaring a hiatus in 2000.\nIn 2003, Claypool and LaLonde reunited with Alexander and released a DVD/EP, Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People, before touring sporadically through 2009. In 2010, it was announced that Lane had rejoined Primus, replacing Alexander, and the band released their eighth album, Green Naugahyde, in 2011. In 2013, Lane left the band to focus on other projects, and Tim Alexander rejoined once again.\nPrimus are characterized by their irreverent, quirky approach to music. They have released some of their records on Claypool's Prawn Song Records label, the name of which is a parody of Led Zeppelin's Swan Song label.\nTRACKLIST:\n\n1. Sgt. Baker\n2. American Life\n3.
