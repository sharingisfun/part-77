Together, they each bring their own experience and tastes in music to create something truly matchless. Norever wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be who they are without each member having their own individual love in music. \n\nA dream was born with Daniel White, even at a young age, the guitar brought about a curious fascination. As soon as he learned his first three chords he knew music was what he wanted to do with his life. He has spent most of his early teen years searching for his sound, working on his guitar skills and crafting some remarkable lyrics. Playing with many garage bands through out his life, he founded Norever. \n\nDuncan McKenzie was brought into the group in 2004. Although Duncan hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t much practical experience on drumming he was very determined to learn, receiving his first drum kit on his 16th birthday. Through much practice and reinvention, Duncan had fought his way to grow both musically and personally. Together Daniel and Duncan had the Melody and the beat, what they needed was the harmony. A deep fan with much respect for Daniel as a musician and as a friend, David Heilmen was added to the group. He was the harmony that was much needed. He brought soulful singing and an aggressive energy on the guitar to the group giving it a rounded effect. \n\nTogether, Daniel and David entered into a frenzy of writing to create their first demo effort. After years of struggle, they crossed the threshold into recording a demo together as Norever in the studio of producer Dave Dunlop. Each song having a deep and personal meaning and its own unique presence to them. A monthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of hard work went into the three song sampler and was released April 18th, 2006. They had a piece of the puzzle together and a taste of the dream they longed for. Even after all the trials and hard ships each member had to endure both personal and musically, they had come together to create a finished product that was truly unique with each song bringing something different to the listener.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ca9ca19acb4ba91c78b5affa76177719173ad20","amp;dn":"Norever+-+One+Last+Breath","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ca9ca19acb4ba91c78b5affa76177719173ad20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,169,202,25,172,180,186,145,199,139,90,255,167,97,119,113,145,115,173,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
