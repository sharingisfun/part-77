Corsi is the author of Where's the Birth Certificate?: The Case that Barack Obama is not Eligible to be President and, most recently, Who Really Killed Kennedy?: 50 Years Later: Stunning New Revelations About the JFK Assassination, a book arguing that the Kennedy assassination was organized at the highest levels of government by former CIA boss Allen Dulles with the support of then vice president LBJ. \n\nAlex also talks with investigator Bob Fletcher and whistleblower Deborah Tavares about smart meters, cyclotronic warfare, and mind control.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
