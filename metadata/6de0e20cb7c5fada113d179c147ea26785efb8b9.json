What happens &quot;down-under&quot; in the soil controls what plants can do. Vigorous, healthy plant growth is possible only on soils that can provide all the essential nutrients. &quot;Gardening Down-under&quot; provides: information on soils and potting mixes. It shows why these media are the way they are, how they &quot;work&quot; and how you can manage and improve them; detailed information about fertilisers; many quick &quot;recipes&quot; for activities such as making compost, overcoming water repellency, applying water and fertiliser, and altering pH; answers to questions about soils, potting mixes and fertilisers; and colour guides to nutrient deficiencies. This is a book for practical gardeners. Easily understood, yet authoritative, this book by Kevin Handreck, a leading CSIRO expert on soils, aims to help the reader improve the worst of soils, select the best fertilisers for particular plants and minimize water use. It also contains comprehensive information about managing potted plants.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6de0e20cb7c5fada113d179c147ea26785efb8b9","amp;dn":"Gardening+Down-under+-+Kevin+Handreck","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6de0e20cb7c5fada113d179c147ea26785efb8b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,224,226,12,183,197,250,218,17,61,23,156,20,126,162,103,133,239,184,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
