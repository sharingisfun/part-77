They arrived late and to be honest I could not ask them to close the - already long - row. So I had the reshuffle the row a bit, to reassign a more logical place. No one expects to find Simon &amp; Garfunkel at the bottom. A lot of work. However, music is a living thing and so some of the other portraits had already undergone some make over. And ordered in five more or less matching rows, it all makes more sense now. So its not too bad to download it again.\n\nIts a kind of sketch of old and new Pop Music in 75 Portraits (about 10% I portrayed). All in the best MP3 (unfortunately?) tracks I could find and all ordered (so you can play it as a real Playlist). I hope the Artists and You can appreciate it.... Enjoy (and listen to these girls and boys; they really have something to say)\n\n\nDutch Treat B026-030 (5 Top Folk Artists)\n\nB026 God's Song (John Martyn)\n\n 01 John Martyn - The Easy Blues\n 02 John Martyn - Over The Hill\n 03 John &amp; Beverley Martyn - Tree Green\n 04 John Martyn - Pascanel\n 05 John Martyn - Certain Surprise\n 06 John Martyn - Solid Air\n 07 John Martyn - Rock, Salt And Nails\n 08 John Martyn - Back Down The River\n 09 John Martyn - Walking Home\n 10 John Martyn - He's Got All The Whiskey\n 11 John Martyn - Baby Please Come Home\n 12 John Martyn - Cool In This Life\n 13 John Martyn - Ghosts\n 14 John Martyn - Under My Wing\n 15 John Martyn - May You Never\n 16 John Martyn - Cobbles\n 17 John Martyn - Wildflower\n 18 John Martyn - Just Now\n 19 John Martyn - One For The Road\n 20 John Martyn - Spencer The Rover\n 21 John Martyn - Sweet Little Mystery\n 22 John Martyn - Glory Box\n 23 John Martyn - Strange Fruit\n 24 John Martyn - Small Town Talk\n 25 John Martyn - One Day Without You\n 26 John Martyn - Excuse Me Mister\n 27 John Martyn - Hole In The Rain\n 28 John Martyn - God's Song\n 29 John Martyn - Death Don't Have No Mercy\n 30 John Martyn - Send Me One Line (L)\n\nB027 I Remember (Damien Rice)\n\n 01 Damien Rice - Baby Sister (L)\n 02 Damien Rice - Childish (Live At Wisseloord Studios)\n 03 Damien Rice - Woman Like A Man (Live Unplugged)\n 04 Damien Rice - Be My Husband (L)\n 05 Damien Rice - I Remember\n 06 Damien Rice - Cross-Eyed Bear\n 07 Damien Rice - Volcano\n 08 Damien Rice &amp; Tori Amos - The Power Of Orange Knikers\n 09 Damien Rice - Dogs\n 10 Damien Rice - Rootless Tree\n 11 Damien Rice - Lonelily\n 12 Damien Rice - Cannonball (A)\n 13 Damien Rice - Waters Of March\n 14 Damien Rice - Rat Within The Grain\n 15 Damien Rice - The Professor And La Fille Danse (L)\n 16 Damien Rice - Delicate\n 17 Damien Rice - The Blowers Daughter\n 18 Damien Rice - Elephant\n 19 MÃ¢â‚¬Å¡lanie Laurent - Everything You're Not Supposed To Be (Ft.
