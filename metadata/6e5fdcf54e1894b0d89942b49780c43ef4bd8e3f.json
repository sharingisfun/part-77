The voice is AT&amp;T Natural Voice NeoSpeech Paul 16 using TextAloud at settings -3 &amp; -3, 24 kbps to minimize file size, quality is the same. Total time is about 150 hours. I couldn't find any audios of these books so made my own. Not that great, many errors, could be better, but still better than any other audio of these books which I couldn't find. Many of the Kzin names are spelled out rather than spoken because the TTS program couldn't recognize them as speech.  \n \nThe numbers before each story indicate the chronological order (although the file did not load with the correct numerical sequence) and it's best to listen in the numerical order. I'll be finishing the Known Space Tales &amp; short stories, not found in audio elsewhere, in the near future. Destiny's Forge is in a separate torrent. As a novice I couldn't get earlier &quot;Complete&quot; torrent to seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e5fdcf54e1894b0d89942b49780c43ef4bd8e3f","amp;dn":"MAN-KZIN+WARS+BOOKS+I-XIII","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e5fdcf54e1894b0d89942b49780c43ef4bd8e3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,95,220,245,78,24,148,176,216,153,66,180,151,128,196,62,244,189,142,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
