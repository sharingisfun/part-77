In this brave and searingly frank memoir, she describes those first horrifying moments and her long journey since. She has written an engrossing, unsentimental, beautifully poised account: as she struggles through the first months following the tragedy, furiously clenched against a reality that she cannot face and cannot deny; and then, over the ensuing years, as she emerges reluctantly, slowly allowing her memory to take her back through the rich and joyous life sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mourning, from her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home in London, to the birth of her children, to the year she met her English husband at Cambridge, to her childhood in Colombo; all the while learning the difficult balance between the almost unbearable reminders of her loss and the need to keep her family, somehow, still alive within her.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71001cfdff81cde4e97a1a6e21f06bf14437643c","amp;dn":"WAVE+-+Sonali+Deraniyagala","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71001cfdff81cde4e97a1a6e21f06bf14437643c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,0,28,253,255,129,205,228,233,122,26,110,33,240,107,241,68,55,100,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
