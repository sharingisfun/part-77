To help you find your way, here's a quick look at how\nthis book is organized:\n\nIn Part 1 I'll reveal security's weakest link and show you why you and\nyour company are at risk from social engineering attacks.\n\nIn Part 2 you'll see how social engineers toy with your trust, your desire tobe helpful, your sympathy, and your human gullibility to get what they\nwant. Fictional stories of typical attacks will demonstrate that social\nengineers can wear many hats and many faces. If you think you've never\nencountered one, you're probably wrong. Will you recognize a scenario\nyou've experienced in these stories and wonder if you had a brush with\nsocial engineering? You very well might. But once you've read Chapters 2\nthrough 9, you'll know how to get the upper hand when the next social\nengineer comes calling.\n\nPart 3 is the part of the book where you see how the social engineer ups\nthe ante, in made-up stories that show how he can step onto your\ncorporate premises, steal the kind of secret that can make or break your\ncompany, and thwart your hi-tech security measures. The scenarios in this\nsection will make you aware of threats that range from simple employee\nrevenge to cyber terrorism. If you value the information that keeps your\nbusiness running and the privacy of your data, you'll want to read\nChapters 10 through 14 from beginning to end.It's important to note that unless otherwise stated, the anecdotes in this\nbook are purely fictional.\n\nIn Part 4 I talk the corporate talk about how to prevent successful social\nengineering attacks on your organization. Chapter 15 provides a blueprint\nfor a successful security-training program. And Chapter 16 might just\nsave your neck - it's a complete security policy you can customize for\nyour organization and implement right away to keep your company and\ninformation safe.Finally, I've provided a Security at a Glance section, which includes checklists, tables, and charts that summarize key information you can useto help your employees foil a social engineering attack on the job. These tools also provide valuable information you can use in devising your own security-training program.\n\nThroughout the book you'll also find several useful elements: Lingo boxes\nprovide definitions of social engineering and computer hacker\nterminology; Mitnick Messages offer brief words of wisdom to help\nstrengthen your security strategy; and notes and sidebars give interesting\nbackground or additional information.\n\n[b]Book Details :\n\nSize : 5.4 Mb\nPages : 577\nTitle : THE ART OF DECEPTION\nFormat : pdf[/b]\n\nFollow us on facebook...\n\nhttp:// www. facebook. com/torrentsharing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:723eb99fd89c63411997186a6b4d726864e76575","amp;dn":"Kevin_Mitnick_-_Art_Of_Deception.pdf+%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+Torrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"723eb99fd89c63411997186a6b4d726864e76575","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,62,185,159,216,156,99,65,25,151,24,106,107,77,114,104,100,231,101,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
