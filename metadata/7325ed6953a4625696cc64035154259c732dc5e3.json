Instead, despite a disastrous encounter with the new assistant district attorney, Mason Deveraux, she's picked as a juror on a murder case. As the trial progresses, she realizes an ominous vision she had in the men's restroom proves the defendant is innocent. And there's not a cotton picking thing she can do about it. Or is there? As if things weren't bad enough, Rose's older sister Violet is going through a mid-life crisis. Violet insists that Rose stop seeing her sexy new boyfriend, Arkansas state detective Joe Simmons, and date other men. Rose is done letting people boss her around, but she can't commit to Joe either. Still, Rose isn't about to let the best thing in her life slip away.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7325ed6953a4625696cc64035154259c732dc5e3","amp;dn":"Twenty-Nine+and+a+Half+Reasons+-+Denise+Grover+Swank.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7325ed6953a4625696cc64035154259c732dc5e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,37,237,105,83,164,98,86,150,204,100,3,81,84,37,156,115,45,197,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
