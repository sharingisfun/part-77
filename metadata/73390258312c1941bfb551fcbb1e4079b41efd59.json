Meat is in absolute top form and sounds as good as 10 years ago. The show is dynamic and full of energy and so is the crowd. Meat Loaf is clearly enjoying himself on stage. The video is all high quality and from different angles with superb close-up and great overview clips. The venue is also very beautiful. And the sound quality is almost soundboard  material. If you only want one DVD from this tour, then this is the one. Although the DVD does miss 5 minutes of the encore ( 'Boneyard' is missing) this still is a DVD that blows me away. This bootleg gives a great impression of the 'Last at Bat' tour. All in all I can't express how happy I am with this. A perfect concert DVD deserves a perfect score. 5 out of 5 stars!\n \nRunning Time: 142 minutes\n\nSETLIST:\n01 When I'm 64\n02 Runnin' for the Redlight\n03 Life is a Lemon\n04 Dead Ringer\n05 Break It\n06 Los Angeloser\n07 The Giving Tree\n08 Objects in the Rearview Mirror\n09 Out of the Frying Pan\n10 Bat Out of Hell\n11 You Took the Words\n12 Heaven Can Wait\n13 All Revved Up\n14 Two Out of Three\n15 Paradise by the Dashboard Light\n16 Speech\n17 For Crying Out loud\n18 Anything for Love\n19 Freebird Jam\n20 Band Introduction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73390258312c1941bfb551fcbb1e4079b41efd59","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+Last+At+Bat+Frankfurt+Festhalle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73390258312c1941bfb551fcbb1e4079b41efd59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,57,2,88,49,44,25,65,191,181,81,252,187,30,64,121,180,30,253,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
