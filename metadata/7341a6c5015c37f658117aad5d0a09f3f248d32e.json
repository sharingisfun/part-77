And who can ever\nforget the scene in which Danny Bonaduce (Richie) finds himself in bed\nwith a live seal and enjoying the action? God knows I have tried to\nforget, but it is stained on my retina.\n\nThere are lots and lots and lots of flopping, nude women in this movie,\nwhich serves its purpose rather well I guess. However, when you are done\nlooking at the girls, some scenes to watch out for are: robot maid\nenters sorority house to find the secret cache of stolen money, extra\nlarge nude woman saves the day in a hot air balloon, and perhaps the\nstrangest -- girls make hundreds of dollars selling &quot;pies&quot; consisting\nonly of whip cream on a plate with glued-on nude sorority girl pictures.\n\nIf for nothing else, apart from the Bonaduce madness and the kooky\nbumbling crooks, you have to see this movie to observe the unmeasurable\nextremes filmmakers will go to in trying to justify what is patently\ngratuitous nudity.
