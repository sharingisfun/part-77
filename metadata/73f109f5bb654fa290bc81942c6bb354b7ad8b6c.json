Eklavya had to sacrifice his right thumb as Gurudakshina to Drona to uphold ArjunaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supremacy in archery, which caused the end of EklavyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s potential as an archer. While making the film on this mythological incident Arif is confronted with a new truth. At the shooting spot he comes to know from the Santals who gather to see the shooting that for archery the arrow needs to be held between right index and middle fingers- the thumb has no role to play in it. This revelation makes Arif and his associates extremely amazed. Deep in his heart Arif gets puzzled with the question then why did Eklavya had to pay his right thumb as Gurudakshina if it was not essential for archery? There begins ArifÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new analysis, and as a result a novel episode takes shape mingling the realism of the past with the present.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73f109f5bb654fa290bc81942c6bb354b7ad8b6c","amp;dn":"Rupantor+%5BDVDRIP%5D+%28A+Film+By+Abu+Sayeed%29.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73f109f5bb654fa290bc81942c6bb354b7ad8b6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,241,9,245,187,101,79,162,144,188,129,148,44,107,179,84,183,173,139,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
