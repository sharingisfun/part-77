Caused  quite  a stir among\n |  Atlantic City's most wanted. Now every thief, crook  and  hood  wants  a\n |  piece  of  the pie. The local gangs have already claimed the turf around\n |  the factories and have started poaching  their  stocks  of  weapons. I'm\n |  gonna beat the hell outta them and take over the entire operation. While\n |  I'm  at  it, I  might  as well get some new toys for my boys. After all,\n |  they deserve nothin' but the best weapons available.\n |\n |  Deadeye  Hastings  is a notorious marksman killer and a crafty thief. He\n |  has served a decade in jail in England and the  royal  authorities  were\n |  relieved  to  find  out that he departed the islands to become a problem\n |  for the US government.\n |\n |  Most  people  look  in  the  face  of  Johnny Hastings and think he is a\n |  monster but little do they know what  kind  of  monster  he  is. Deadeye\n |  Hastings has always had problems with self-esteem and with keeping  calm\n |  under pressure. He is constantly trying to compensate this with reckless\n |  demeanor dragging his comrades into unpredictable situations. Anyone who\n |  wants to have dealings with him should mind that he is far from reliable\n |  but Hastings himself cares little about what people think about him - he\n |  just wants to have fun!\n |\n |  Features :\n |\n |  Ã¢â€Â¬Ã¢â€¢â€˜ New Henchman: Johnny &quot;Deadeye&quot; Hastings.\n |  Ã¢â€Â¬Ã¢â€¢â€˜ New Weapon: Vendetta.\n |  Ã¢â€Â¬Ã¢â€¢â€˜ New District: Industrial District.\n |\n |  Note : This DLC is  available after succesfully completing the first two\n |  missions of the single player campaign.\n |\n |  Damsel in Distress DLC :\n |\n |  I got a call from New York. Lucky Luciano wanted my help in getting  The\n |  Kid  on his side. Piece of cake, he said. I wanted Luciano's connections\n |  in  the  Big  Apple,  so  I  agreed. What I didn't know was that The Kid\n |  didn't want to be on Luciano's side. That was how the  trouble  started.\n |  Piece of cake? I never did like cake.\n |\n |  Henry McCarty had the unremarkable childhood of  a  typical  Texas  farm\n |  boy. Henry  was  a  hot-shot  and  a  rascal and not so much fond of his\n |  father. When the old man lost the McCarty ranch to the  bank, the  young\n |  Henry finally rebelled and took off to seek his own fate.\n |\n |  In  the  next ten years Henry changed a handful of jobs. By the start of\n |  the War McCarty already had problems with local criminals and decided to\n |  abandon the state of Texas. Packing his arrogant temper, his  disdainful\n |  attitude  towards  the spoiled city-boys and a pair of trusty revolvers,\n |  he headed to New York City. Fate finally smiled on him and he joined the\n |  gang  of  Lucky  Luciano,  becoming  one  of  his  most  dangerous   and\n |  resourceful men.\n |\n |  Features :\n |\n |  Ã¢â€Â¬Ã¢â€¢â€˜ New Henchman: Henry &quot;The Kid&quot; McCarty.\n |  Ã¢â€Â¬Ã¢â€¢â€˜ New Weapon: Golden Twins.\n |  Ã¢â€Â¬Ã¢â€¢â€˜ New District: The Suburbs.\n |\n |  Note : This DLC is available after successfully completing the first two\n |  missions of the single player campaign.\n |\n |  The Con Artist DLC :\n |\n |  A  letter  arrived  today. The  envelope  was  thick with the smell of a\n |  woman's  perfume. It  was  an  invitation,  but  not  the  invitation  I\n |  expected.  It was a call to take part in the &quot;Greatest con of all time.&quot;\n |  Intrigued, I  followed  the message to one of the  wealthiest  parts  of\n |  Atlantic City. The place was full of rich little  good-for-nothings  who\n |  never had to work for a living - the perfect setting for a scam.\n |\n |  New  Jersey,  February  1919.  A  young  woman  claiming to be Anastasia\n |  Romanov disappears after raising a considerable sum of money from  local\n |  Russian  immigrants  who  supported   the  royalist  regime  in  Russia.\n |  The  police  suspected a con scheme but the very people  that  gave  the\n |  money  truly  believed  that  the  self-proclaimed Romanov has gone into\n |  hiding because of Soviet spies threatening her life.\n |\n |  The  person  in  question  was  Anna  Anderson. She  is  known  to  be a\n |  charismatic  and  influential   socialite   with  striking  good  looks.\n |  Her personality baffles investigators and  people  acquainted  with  the\n |  case and on one could tell whether this was a  brilliant con act or  the\n |  naked truth.\n |\n |  Features :\n |\n       New Henchman: Anna Anderson.\n |  Ã¢â€Â¬Ã¢â€¢â€˜ New Weapon: The Mohaska.\n |  Ã¢â€Â¬Ã¢â€¢â€˜ New District: Connecticut Ave.\n |\n |  Note : This DLC is available after successfully completing the first two\n |  missions of the single player campaign.\n |                                                                           :\n |  More info :                                                              |\n |                                                                           |\n |  Omerta City of Gangsters :                                               |\n |                                                                           |\n | &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.gog.com/game/omerta_city_of_gangsters&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.gog.com/game/omerta_city_of_gangsters&lt;/a&gt;                         |\n |                                                                           |\n |  The Arms Industry DLC :                                                  |\n |                                                                           |\n | &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.gog.com/game/omerta_city_of_gangsters_the_arms_industry_dlc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.gog.com/game/omerta_city_of_gangsters_the_arms_industry_dlc&lt;/a&gt;   |\n |                                                                           |\n |  Damsel in Distress DLC :                                                 |\n |                                                                           |\n | &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.gog.com/game/omerta_city_of_gangsters_damsel_in_distress_dlc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.gog.com/game/omerta_city_of_gangsters_damsel_in_distress_dlc&lt;/a&gt;  |\n |                                                                           |\n |  The Con Artist DLC :                                                     |\n |                                                                           |\n | &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.gog.com/game/omerta_city_of_gangsters_the_con_artist_dlc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.gog.com/game/omerta_city_of_gangsters_the_con_artist_dlc&lt;/a&gt;      |\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75a9e2aa998434dbe3c1f1287246027873443a00","amp;dn":"Omerta_City_Of_Gangsters_Complete_Pack-VACE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75a9e2aa998434dbe3c1f1287246027873443a00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,169,226,170,153,132,52,219,227,193,241,40,114,70,2,120,115,68,58,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
