I Really Wanted You\n\nMascott's debut full-length record Follow the Sound is a full-bodied pop experience that runs steadily on Kendall Jane Meade's soft and heavenly vocals. At times recalling elements of Joni Mitchell and St. Etienne's Sarah Cracknell, Follow the Sound plays with some very unpredictable chord changes, making the album all the more listenable for its unexpectedness. Meade is certainly not your everyday run-of-the-mill singer/songwriter. Her guitar work is stylish and skillful, illustrating her extensive background in music. And, as a touring member of Helium and the Spinanes, Meade has certainly made a number of friends in the world of indie pop, many of whom contribute their services -- both in terms of performance and production -- to Follow the Sound. Gastr Del Sol's Jim O'Rourke, Stars, and Shoestrings' Mario Suau (as well as Meade herself) produced the record, while Noel Kupersmith of Brokeback, the Mekons' Sally Timms, and others sat in on the sessions as well. A great deal of the album's roundness may be due to the fact that it was produced with so many people and in so many locales (New York, Detroit, and Chicago, just to name a few). But considering the sheer volume of talent on Follow the Sound, the instrumentation is still sparse enough to leave room for Meade's breathy voice and intimate words, which resonate with the utmost of sincerity. Follow the Sound is a truly beautiful and understated pop record. -AllMusic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:766ed972d5f41bc088bfde22d09490ff9f85f315","amp;dn":"Mascott+-+Follow+The+Sound+%5B2000%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"766ed972d5f41bc088bfde22d09490ff9f85f315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,110,217,114,213,244,27,192,136,191,222,34,208,148,144,255,159,133,243,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
