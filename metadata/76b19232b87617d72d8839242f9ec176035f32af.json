It follows the trials and travails of Chef Vivian Howard and her husband, Ben Knight, and their farm-to-table restaurant, Chef &amp; the Farmer, exploring both traditional and modern applications of quintessential Southern ingredients. Vivian's skill in the kitchen is an equal match for her charismatic personality, radiating behind crystal grey eyes.\n\nMuch more dynamic than a typical cooking show, A Chef's Life is a character-driven documentary and cooking series, broadcasting nationally on PBS stations starting September 2013. The first season consists of 13 half-hour episodes.\n\n\n\n\nA Chef's Life - Season 1, Episode 1\n\n\n\n\nSweet Corn &amp; Expensive Tea\n\nVivian and her husband Ben leave New York to open a restaurant in her small North Carolina hometown.
