Is Hell Without Love?\n\nDGM originally formed in 1994 as an entirely instrumental band. Their first official release is the self-produced mini CD Ã¢â‚¬ËœRandom Access ZoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ but the full album comes out in November Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ97: Ã¢â‚¬ËœChange DirectionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The album received great responses everywhere: Italy, Germany, Finland, Denmark, etc. which prompted to start an Italian tour that gave the band the reputation as one of the most promising progressive Italian act in those years.\n\nWith the new drummer Fabio Costantino (ex-Carnal Raptor), thanks to his great technical experience and his fine musical taste, DGM entered the studio for their incredible second album: Ã¢â‚¬ËœWings Of TimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (top album on the most important Italian magazines Ã¢â‚¬Å“Metal ShockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“FlashÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Metal hammerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). In Japan the CD sold over 4,000 copies in the first 10 days. The band was also contacted by BURRN! for an exclusive interview that enlarged DGM reputation in the worldwide musical scene.\n\nIn 2002 Scarlet Records took the Italian musicians under their wings, asking them to sign a contract and laying the foundations of a new album.\n\nIn 2005 Simone Mularoni (Empyrios) replaced Diego Reali, Simone is considered simply a genius of the six strings, who naturally owns the peculiar DGM sound. With Simone DGM had the possibilities to reach a more fresh sounds due to his metal influences and his experience as a sound engineer and producer at the Fear Studios. With such a great axe man DGM needed another monstrous keyboard player able to be the right arm of Simone, Emanuele Casali (Astra, ex-Empyrios) was the best and only possible choice after Fabio Sanges left.\n\nSimone and Emanuele gave to the new songs a renewed touch of class and the result of his experience is all included in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Different ShapesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ released in 2007. The media claims Ã¢â‚¬ËœDifferent ShapesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as the best work of DGM so far, a beautiful production managed Simone himself made Rock Hard and Metal Hammer awarding it as TOP ALBUM. On the live front, DGM played for the second time at the Gods Of Metal (2007) together with Heaven&amp;Hell, Dream Theater, Symphony X, Dark Tranquillity among others, Lagoa Burning Festival (2007), Prog-Power Europe (2007) as a confirmation of the high quality of Ã¢â‚¬ËœDifferent ShapesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nIn February 2007 DGM announced that Mark Basile (B.R.A.K.E., ex Mind Key) was the new singer of the band. Mark was chosen among several auditions throughout Italy, Europe and America after Titta Tani left the band.\n\nIn Autumn of 2008 DGM give light to the seventh album of their career: Ã¢â‚¬ËœFrameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ DGM are nowadays considered undoubtedly one of EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading progressive metal acts, always pushing the boundaries with their technical and refined musical skills, which allowed them to be included among prog metal fansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ favorites. Ã¢â‚¬ËœFrameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is probably the most perfect think DGM are ever done, MarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice is something unbelievable, Simone guitar plying will leave you breathless, EmanueleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harmonies will bring you on new musical conceptions while the Andrea and Fabio create a wall of rhythmic session where to leave an indelible trail in the worldwide metal scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7850b66a8ede21646b538343c65fe5e73d22ab0d","amp;dn":"DGM+-+Synthesis+%282011%29+%28DVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7850b66a8ede21646b538343c65fe5e73d22ab0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,80,182,106,142,222,33,100,107,83,131,67,198,95,229,231,61,34,171,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
