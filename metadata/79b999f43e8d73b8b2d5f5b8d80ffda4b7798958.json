In the Arbuckle household, it's quite a challenge. One day, Jon Arbuckle chanced upon a TV commercial for a new and amazing gadget: the Bath-o-Matic Robot! The robot chases and catches dirty pets and scrubs and washes them clean. Once the robot is on the loose, the crazy chase begins! Will Garfield and Odie outrun the robot? And will Garfield actually get some exercise in the process?\n\n15 CHALLENGING LEVELS IN 4 DIFFERENT PARTS OF GARFIELDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S HOUSE\nYou play the role of Garfield and Odie.
