Take Your Clothes Off 1:53\n\nHaving the album in this format allows the listener to shuffle the album into a countless number of entirely new listening experiences, each just as seamless and cohesive as the last, just as Frank predicted:\n\n&quot;It's all one album. All the material [...] is organically related and if I had all the master tapes and I could take a razor blade and cut them apart and put it together again in a different order it still would make one piece of music you can listen to. Then I could take that razor blade and cut it apart and reassemble it a different way, and it still would make sense. I could do this twenty ways.&quot; (Miles, Barry (16 Sep 2005).

Grove/Atlantic, Incorporated. p. 480.)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://globalia.net/donlope/fz/lyrics/Lumpy_Gravy.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://globalia.net/donlope/fz/lyrics/Lumpy_Gravy.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.arf.ru/Notes/Lg/lg1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.arf.ru/Notes/Lg/lg1.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpy_Gravy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpy_Gravy&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b5125683f546a62670a89875fe9402e3d15c147","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Lumpy+Gravy+indexed+%282012+CD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b5125683f546a62670a89875fe9402e3d15c147","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,81,37,104,63,84,106,98,103,10,137,135,95,233,64,46,61,21,193,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
