The United States splintered into fifty walled cities where the surviving citizens clustered to start over. The Company, which ended the plague by bringing a life-saving vaccine back from the future, controls everything. They ration the scant food and supplies through a lottery system, mandate daily doses of virus suppressant, and even monitor future timelines to stop crimes before they can be committed.\n\nBrilliant but autistic, sixteen-year-old Clover Donovan has always dreamed of studying at the Waverly-Stead Academy. Her brother and caretaker, West, has done everything in his power to make her dream a reality. But CloverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s refusal to part with her beloved service dog denies her entry into the school. Instead, she is drafted into the Time Mariners, a team of Company operatives who travel through time to gather news about the future.\n\nWhen one of CloverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s missions reveals that WestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is in danger, the Donovans are shattered. To change WestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to take on the mysterious Company. But as its secrets are revealed, they realize that the CompanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rule may not be as benevolent as it seems. In saving her brother, Clover will face a more powerful force than she ever imaginedÃ‚â€¦ and will team up with a band of fellow misfits and outsiders to incite a revolution that will change their destinies forever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cf44812cdca614ae23d9bff66c315414f67d4f2","amp;dn":"Viral+Nation+%28Viral+Nation+%231%29+-+Shaunta+Grimes.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cf44812cdca614ae23d9bff66c315414f67d4f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,244,72,18,205,202,97,74,226,61,155,255,102,195,21,65,79,103,212,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
