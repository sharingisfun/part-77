He has been a regular panelist on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue and Just a Minute, the latter of which he also chaired. In 1998, Barry wrote his autobiography, You Won't Believe This But..., which has been broadcast on Radio 4.\n\nBarry is also famous for having written gags for some of the legends of British comedy, including Morecambe and Wise, Tommy Cooper, Stanley Baxter, Dick Emery, Dave Allen, Les Dawson, Bob Hope, Kenny Everett, Sir Harry Secombe, Billy Connolly, Jasper Carrot, and Richard Pryor.\n\nWith a CV that reads like the &quot;Who's Who of British Comedy Greats&quot;, Cryer's unique blend of old-school gentility and cutting edge intellect facilitates an audience-base that spans generations. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d070ca8daa3ad519bc072bba42406797869e6d4","amp;dn":"An+Audience+with+Barry+Cryer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d070ca8daa3ad519bc072bba42406797869e6d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,7,12,168,218,163,173,81,155,192,114,187,164,36,6,121,120,105,230,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
