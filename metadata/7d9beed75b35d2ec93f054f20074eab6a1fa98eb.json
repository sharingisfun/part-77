Probably in the area of 150 people. The sound check started 25 minutes late as Paul was stuck in traffic. During the sound check, the heat was blistering, luckily by show time, the temperature had gone down to a manageable 80 degrees or so. Paul mentioned how great it was to be playing Yankee Stadium. There was very little interaction as it seemed that they were trying to make up for the lost time. I saw somebody had reported that Get Back was played....not true nor was I saw her standing there. Don't know where that one came from.
