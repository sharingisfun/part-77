This year, however, he is afflicted with an infirmity that renders him unable to use his sword. Rather than give up this important commission and let the martial world know of his precarious health he means to entrust the consignment to two young knights in his manor, Hsiang Ting and Yun Piao-Piao.

Things move fast and there's an awful lot of detail to take in, much of it complicated by frequent flashbacks. It has less action and more talk than usual. Until the big fight finale, most of the fights tend to be short bouts, either friendly ones or tests of opponents' skills.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgsure.com/?p=793383&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgsure.com/?p=793383&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgsure.com/?p=343698&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgsure.com/?p=343698&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe.Big.Boss.1971.720P.BRRIP.XVID.AC3.SUBBED-MAJESTiC   \n\nPlot\nChein is a city boy who moves with his cousins to work at a ice factory.
