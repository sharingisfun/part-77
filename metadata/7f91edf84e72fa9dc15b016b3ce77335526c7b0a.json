These are not corrupt.\n\nThis is an old set of Photoshop video tutorials which helped me immensely when I was completely new to Photoshop.  Again, this is old - the version being used is Photoshop 7.  But it's an excellent introduction for people who have never used Photoshop, at all; many of the functions and tools are explained in a way that I found easier to understand than other such videos.   And, in newer versions, though the interface is different many of these basics remain the same.\n\nThis download is two zip files which, when extracted, constitute the data from the original CDs.  The videos are designed to play in a browser (with Quicktime) and they do not work with Chrome - not sure about newer versions of Explorer (they work in Explorer 8).  Of course, you can just play the videos from the folders on your desktop.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f91edf84e72fa9dc15b016b3ce77335526c7b0a","amp;dn":"Marks+Photoshop+MasterKit+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f91edf84e72fa9dc15b016b3ce77335526c7b0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,145,237,248,78,114,250,157,193,91,1,107,60,231,115,53,82,108,123,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
