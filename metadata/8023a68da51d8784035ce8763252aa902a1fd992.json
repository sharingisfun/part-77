But there's nothing but cold, dark, space out there... Something has triggered the ship's automatic wake-up system ahead of time. But where is the rest of the crew?\n\nIn Breach, you explore a spaceship infested with a mysterious entity. You will need to restore functionality to the ship and its engines to prevent disaster, but you will at the same time need to keep your guard up. You are not alone...\n\n\nGameplay video can be found here:\n\n\nPlease seed if you enjoy the game!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8023a68da51d8784035ce8763252aa902a1fd992","amp;dn":"Breach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8023a68da51d8784035ce8763252aa902a1fd992","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,35,166,141,165,29,135,132,3,92,232,118,50,82,170,144,42,31,217,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
