With Inpaint's Multi View feature, all you have to do is take several shots of the same scene, assuming that the objects you want to remove are moving. Once you've taken enough pictures so that every piece of the scenery is visible, just sit back and let Inpaint do the work.\n\nNo need for tripods or any special tools; and no need to worry about shaking hands when making the photos. Inpaint will take care of this and align your photos perfectly.\n\nStep 1: Take multiple shots of your subject.\nNo need to worry about the people or objects that may be spoiling the otherwise perfect picture!\n\nStep 2: Load the images into Inpaint.\nOpen the image which you want to edit and add alternate images of the same scene.\n\nStep 3: Remove the people!\nMoving the cursor allows you to see what is under this area. If you have more than two images, selecting an image from the list allows you to change the donor area. You can then control which area from which image will be taken and used.\n\nStep 4: Say goodbye to the unwanted objects and save!\nIt looks like magic: moving objects such as vehicles, construction work, or simply other tourists disappear from the photos in a few clicks! The parts taken from the donor pictures seamlessly replace the tourists, making the resulted photo much better.\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\nOperation system: \nWindows: Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8\n\nHomepage: http://www.theinpaint.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Register application with given key.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80ce4d1c05b6a05f1931a4d39eb4f68394eee5bd","amp;dn":"Teorex+MultiView+Inpaint+v1.0.0+with+Key+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80ce4d1c05b6a05f1931a4d39eb4f68394eee5bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,206,77,28,5,182,160,95,25,49,164,211,158,180,246,131,148,238,229,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
