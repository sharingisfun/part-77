I have 150 books coming tomorrow. \n\nThis concise biography of StÃƒÂ©phane MallarmÃƒÂ© (1842Ã¢â‚¬â€œ98) blends an account of the poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life with a detailed analysis of his evolving poetic theory and practice. Ã¢â‚¬Å“A poet on this earth must be uniquely a poet,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he declared at the age of twenty-twoÃ¢â‚¬â€but what is a poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and what is a poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s function? In his poems and prose statements and by the example of his life, MallarmÃƒÂ© provided answers to these questions.\n\n            In StÃƒÂ©phane MallarmÃƒÂ©, Roger Pearson explores the relationship among MallarmÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s life, his philosophy, and his writing. To MallarmÃƒÂ©, being a poet consists of a continuous, lifelong investigation of language and its expressive potential. It represents, argues Pearson, a fundamental response to the metaphysical mystery of the human condition and the desire to make sense of it for others.
