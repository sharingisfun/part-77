In addition to Coltrane on soprano and tenor, pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones, the participants include both bassist Reggie Workman and his eventual replacement, Jimmy Garrison, and (for atmosphere) veteran Garvin Bushell on oboe and contrabassoon on two numbers and Ahmed Abdul-Malik added on oud for one. The music is comprised of &quot;India,&quot; &quot;Greensleeves,&quot; &quot;Chasin' the Trane,&quot; two versions of &quot;Spiritual&quot; and a lengthy &quot;Untitled Original.&quot; Throughout this two-fer the music is passionate, often intense and innovative with Coltrane reducing the number of chords down to a minimum in favor of drones and vamps.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1\n01 - Chasin' The Trane \n02 - Spiritual  \n03 - Untitled Original (Brazilia) \n\nCD2\n01 - India \n02 - Greensleeves \n03 - Spiritual \n\n*1987, 1992 Impulse! / MCA | MCAD2-4137\n\n\n\nPersonnel: John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison, Reggie         Workman, Elvin Jones, Garvin Bushell.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81195cfc07188b008db4f495db81b5683cbadbb1","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+The+Other+Village+Vanguard+Tapes+%281961%29+%5BEAC-FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81195cfc07188b008db4f495db81b5683cbadbb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,25,92,252,7,24,139,0,141,180,244,149,219,129,181,104,60,186,219,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
