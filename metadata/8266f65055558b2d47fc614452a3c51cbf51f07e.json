The atmosphere developed is both haunting, melancholic and epic and her compositions are full of emotional melodies and evolving layers of synthesizers. It contains heady rhythms close to dub music which puts in relief traditional drums and melodic arrangements that remind many musical styles such as classical, progressive rock or soundtracks.\n\nShe also uses many samples of nature that bring total immersion into her very own universe. This album has been created to touch and rock its listeners into a world of fullness whose only Sleeping Forest has the secret.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.psyshop.com/shop/CDs/haa/haa1cd034.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.psyshop.com/shop/CDs/haa/haa1cd034.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8266f65055558b2d47fc614452a3c51cbf51f07e","amp;dn":"Sleeping+Forest+-+2013+-+Rise+Of+Nature+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8266f65055558b2d47fc614452a3c51cbf51f07e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,102,246,80,85,85,139,45,71,252,97,68,82,163,197,28,191,81,240,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
