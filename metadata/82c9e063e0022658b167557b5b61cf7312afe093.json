About 40 \n\nPercent of these books are either out of publication as Hard Copies or exist as \n\ndead torrents in the torrent graveyard of the internet.\n\n\nWHY UPLOAD eBOOKS ON EARLIER VERSIONS OF PHOTOSHOP ?\n\n\n1. Because some of these eBooks give a rare insight into the techniques of \n\nPhotoshop which eBooks of later versions may not, ( although eBooks of latest \n\nversions are also included).\n\n\n2. Some of these Gems of eBooks can get you out of a tight spot to fix an image \n\nwhen the latest eBooks may not have a solution to your problem.\n\n\nNote : This eBooks collection is only for serious Photoshop users. Those of you \n\nwho are casual users or feel that this library of Photoshop eBooks is of no use or \n\nwaste of time - Please do not download.\n\n\nAs far as possible, an attempt has been made to include exercise files with the \n\neBooks.\n\n\nThe Library consists of a collection of eBooks in .pdf , .chm or Video formats.\n\n\nRoughly, a total of about 300 eBooks are included and each and every aspect of \n\nPhotoshop is covered.\n\n\nThese torrents do not include eBooks which I have previously uploaded.\n\n\nThis torrent includes 3 Files :\n\n\n1) O'Reilly - Photoshop CS6 The Missing Manual + Exr. Files  (pdf Pages 886)\n\n2) Mastering Photoshop For Webdesign Volume  I &amp; II (pdf Pages 394 )\n\n3) Photoshop CS6 For Dummies 2012 (pdf Pages 445)\n\n=============================================================================\n\nSEED AND ENJOY !\n\nTHE UPLOADS  ARE VIRUS / MALWARE FREE.\n\nALL CREDIT TO AN ARMY OF UPLOADERS / CRACKERS / REVERSERS\n\nLEAVE COMMENTS FOR OTHER DOWNLOADERS TO REFER.\n\nAND REMEMBER TO ENJOY !
