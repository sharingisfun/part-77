The Barra MacNeils pulled it all together for Closer to Paradise, combining traditional Celtic/maritime music, with pop, rock, and jazz -- and it works. One can hear the confidence in Stewart MacNeil's songs (the majority of which are co-written by longtime collaborator David Cross) and the skill in the band's playing. Lucy MacNeil shines through with her incredibly gentle, yet powerful voice. From the opening track, &quot;We Celebrate,&quot; until the closing Celtic traditional &quot;Am pige Ruadh (Mouth Music),&quot; the listener is treated to a wealth of songs that demonstrate just how much the band had grown and learned in a relatively short period of time. A gem of an album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8427b461755148ba0837b2af8da7586ab98a5e75","amp;dn":"The+Barra+MacNeils+-+Closer+to+Paradise+%5B1993%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8427b461755148ba0837b2af8da7586ab98a5e75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,39,180,97,117,81,72,186,8,55,178,175,141,167,88,106,185,138,94,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
