Lady Jane Grey is an icon of innocence abused. Remembered as the Ã¢â‚¬ËœNine Days QueenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, she has been mythologized as a child-woman sacrificed to political expedience. But behind the legend lay a rebellious adolescent who became a leader, and no mere victim. Growing up in her shadow, JaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sisters Katherine and Mary would have to tread carefully to survive. The dramatic lives of the younger Grey sisters remain little known, but both women became heirs and rivals to the Tudor monarchs, Mary and Elizabeth I. To gain Queen MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trust, teenaged Katherine ignored JaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final request not to change her religion, only to risk her life with a marriage that threatened Queen ElizabethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s throne. While KatherineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friends fought to save her, the youngest Grey sister, Mary, stayed at court. Though too poor and plain to be significant, she looked set to escape the burden of her royal blood. But then she too fell in love and incurred the QueenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fury. Exploding the many myths of Lady JaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, and casting fresh light onto ElizabethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reign, acclaimed historian Leanda de Lisle brings the Grey sistersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tumultuous world to life: at a time when a royal marriage could gain you a kingdom, or cost you everything.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84454a842e8e9f268ca290f2b4222f5a44ac28fc","amp;dn":"The+Sisters+Who+Would+Be+Queen%3A+The+tragedy+of+Mary%2C+Katherine+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84454a842e8e9f268ca290f2b4222f5a44ac28fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,69,74,132,46,142,159,38,140,162,144,242,180,34,47,90,68,172,40,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
