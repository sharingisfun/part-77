A golden Fender Stratocaster hidden away in an attic for 30 years. A sunburst Gibson Les Paul worth $100,000. Jimi HendrixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Strat burned by the guitarist during a concertÃ¢â‚¬â€and then mysteriously lost for decades. The mint Fender Broadcaster forgotten under a bed in a neighborÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house.
