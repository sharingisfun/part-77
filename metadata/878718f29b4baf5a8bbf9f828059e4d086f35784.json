It will work on smaller tablets like the Nexus 7, but the layout is a little wonky.\n\nPast that, everything should be good to go. Hit the link below to grab the download, install it like any other apk, and enjoy the new interface Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it's definitely a massive improvement over the non-optimized version.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:878718f29b4baf5a8bbf9f828059e4d086f35784","amp;dn":"Twitter+Optimized+for+Tablets+%28Galaxy+Note+10.1+App%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"878718f29b4baf5a8bbf9f828059e4d086f35784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,135,24,242,155,75,175,90,139,191,159,130,128,89,228,208,134,243,87,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
