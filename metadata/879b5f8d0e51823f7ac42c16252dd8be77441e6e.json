Actually these Ten deserve their own series; only tracks Longer 7 minutes (Brothers in Arms is 7:00). All these (too) long Master Pieces you admire so much and sit on an album somewhere (well most of them). So I looked and found (well a lot of them) and made a few bar-proof playlists.\nI'm open for suggestions. \n\nThis Update may contain minor changes and may have been renumbered for accessibility reasons....
