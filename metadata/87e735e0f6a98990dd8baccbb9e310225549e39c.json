The guys are rearing to build this rockin' Bubba-Q from scratch, but things skip a beat when Fobo promises the client that the barbecue will cook 24 chickens at once! Then, Bubba hits a low note when his sister-in-law Arlene entrusts the crew with her very own jukebox to use for inspiration. And just when the team thinks they're in the clear, there's one final obstacle standing in the way.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 09-Sep-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87e735e0f6a98990dd8baccbb9e310225549e39c","amp;dn":"Bubba-Q.S01E04.WS.DSR.x264-NY2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87e735e0f6a98990dd8baccbb9e310225549e39c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,231,53,224,246,169,137,144,221,139,172,203,185,227,16,34,85,73,227,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
