Unfortunately for Lantham, on this particular Saturday morning, &quot;the world&quot; consists of a fretful mother with a missing daughter, and the case she hires him for is about send reality staggering into the gutter like an eighty-year-old drunk.\n\nFrom the posh shadow of Mount Diablo to the kink clubs of San Francisco to the genetic engineering labs of Stanford, Clarke Lantham chases down pieces of the weirdest puzzle he's ever seen, all for the sake of a nineteen-year-old girl whose face he can't stop seeing every time he closes his eyes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:894acefd53352ba1db6951e6c6597353680de569","amp;dn":"And+Then+She+Was+Gone+-+J.+Daniel+Sawyer+.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"894acefd53352ba1db6951e6c6597353680de569","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,74,206,253,83,53,43,161,219,105,81,230,198,89,115,83,104,13,229,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
