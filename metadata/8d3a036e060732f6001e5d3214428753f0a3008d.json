Definition: A U.S. soldier stationed at a Forward Operating Base who avoids combat by remaining at the base, esp. during Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003-2011). Pejorative.\n\nIn the satirical tradition of Catch-22 and M*A*S*H, Fobbit takes us into the chaotic world of BaghdadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Forward Operating Base Triumph. The Forward Operating base, or FOB, is like the back-office of the battlefield Ã¢â‚¬â€œ where people eat and sleep, and where a lot of soldiers have what looks suspiciously like a desk job. Male and female soldiers are trying to find an empty Porta Potty in which to get acquainted, grunts are playing Xbox and watching NASCAR between missions, and a lot of the senior staff are more concerned about getting to the chow hall in time for the Friday night all-you-can-eat seafood special than worrying about little things like military strategy.\n\nDarkly humorous and based on the author's own experiences in Iraq, Fobbit is a fantastic debut that shows us a behind-the-scenes portrait of the real Iraq war.\n\nMP3 CD\nPublisher: Tantor Media; Unabridged,MP3 - Unabridged CD edition (September 10, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1452659559\nISBN-13: 978-1452659558\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
