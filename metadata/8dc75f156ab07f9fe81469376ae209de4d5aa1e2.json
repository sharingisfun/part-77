The voice is AT&amp;T Natural Voice NeoSpeech Paul 16 using TextAloud at settings -3 &amp; -3, 24 kbps to minimize file size, quality is the same. Total time is about 48 hours. I couldn't find any audios of this book so made my own. Not that great, many errors, could be better, but still better than any other audio of this book which I couldn't find.
