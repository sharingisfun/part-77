You have only some clicks to protect/optimize your SWF files.\n\nProtection:\nIdentifier Renaming (Identifier Obfuscation): FSO Reads SWF file and retrieves all identifiers and smartly converts identifier names to meaningless characters.\nObscure Actionscript: FSO protects your ActionScript codes by obscuring them so decompilers cannot retrieve any useful code from protected SWF file.\nStrings Encryption: FSO allows you to select the strings in your SWF file, encrypt them in the SWF file using a very secure encryption algorithm, and decrypt them when needed at runtime.\nEncrypted Domain Locking: FSO will protect your SWF files from being played offline or on other websites. Specify a list of domain names that you want your SWF files to be launched from.The domains you have locked the application to are encrypted inside the SWF files and will only be decrypted at runtime.\nRedirect URL: If your SWF file played offline or on other websites, the user will redirect to this URL.\nMessage: If your SWF file played offline or on other websites, this message will show. (This feature is only supported by ActionScript 3)\n\nThe list of identifiers that FSO renames them are :\nAll Variable Names\nFunction Names and Parameters\nInstance Names\nFrame Labels\nClass Members:\nClass Names\nProperty Names\nMethod Names and Parameters\nPackage Names\n\nOptimization:\nYou have many options to compressing/optimizing SWF files:\nShapes Optimization\nFonts Optimization\nMorphs Optimization\nPictures Optimization\nSounds Optimization\nActionScripts Optimization\nRemove null points\nPacking tag headers\nZlib compression\nRemove Metadata","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94cc79b97405915e7257e89b5fcfac3a1af38cce","amp;dn":"Flash_Secure+Optimizer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94cc79b97405915e7257e89b5fcfac3a1af38cce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,204,121,185,116,5,145,94,114,87,232,155,95,207,172,58,26,243,140,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
