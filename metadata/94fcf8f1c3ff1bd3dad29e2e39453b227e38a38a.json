It premiered at the Fantasia Festival in July, 2001, and stars David Caruso, Peter Mullan, Stephen Gevedon, Paul Guilfoyle, Josh Lucas and Brendan Sexton III. The plot focuses on the growing tension within an asbestos removal crew working at an abandoned mental asylum, which is paralleled by the gradual revelation of a former patient's disturbed past through recorded audio tapes of the patient's hypnotherapy sessions. The film takes place in and around the Danvers State Mental Hospital in Danvers, Massachusetts.\nWhile not a financial success, Session 9 is considered a cult film.[2]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94fcf8f1c3ff1bd3dad29e2e39453b227e38a38a","amp;dn":"session.9.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94fcf8f1c3ff1bd3dad29e2e39453b227e38a38a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,252,248,241,195,255,27,211,218,210,158,46,57,69,59,34,126,56,163,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
