Extract Solar 2.zip\n\n2. Run Solar 2.exe\n\n3. Have fun!\n\n\n\nAbout the Game:\n\nIn most games you see stars in the background, you shoot asteroids or you live on planets. But in Solar 2 you ARE these objects! Enter a universe where you must prove yourself to the resident god-like figure by doing its many bizarre and varied tasks. Or just ignore it and see how big you can grow!\n\nSolar 2 is an open-world, sandbox game set in an infinite abstract universe. Play constructively: grow your system, nurture life on your planets and attack enemy life in huge space battles. Play destructively: crash into other objects and cause chaos, use your orbiting objects like wrecking balls, steal planets from other systems.\n\nKey Features:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Dynamic abstract sandbox universe. Changes and evolves as you do.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Non-linear missions and open-world gameplay.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ No boundaries.
