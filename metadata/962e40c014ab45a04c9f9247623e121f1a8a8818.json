David Brainerd&quot;.[1] The work was taken from Brainerd's own diary, but was substantially changed by Edwards in order to better present an example of a man who countered the Arminian viewpoint.[2][3] The work was a major influence on the domestic and foreign missionary movement of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and has been the most frequently reprinted book by Edwards.[4]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:962e40c014ab45a04c9f9247623e121f1a8a8818","amp;dn":"The+life+and+diary+of+David+Brainerd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"962e40c014ab45a04c9f9247623e121f1a8a8818","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,46,64,192,20,171,69,160,76,159,146,71,98,62,18,31,26,138,136,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
