The franchise's Hall of Fame players and still-record 16 (now 17) championships are revisited in a five double-sided-DVD combination of new and old documentaries and actual game footage. The main documentary, The Celtics Dynasty (47 min.) tracks the team from the '50s through the '80s, and shorter vintage featurettes from the '70s and '80s (about 130 min. total) focus on the 1974 playoffs, the classic 1976 game against the Phoenix Suns that's often called the greatest NBA game ever, the renewed rivalry with the Lakers, and the 1986-87 team. Two NBA highlight films (55 min. each) summarizing the 1984 and 1986 seasons are less Celtic-centric but provide some memorable moments such as Ralph Sampson's miracle shot to beat the Lakers. A postscript needs less than three minutes to discuss the highlights of the franchise since its last championship (1986) through 2004, from Reggie Lewis to Paul Pierce. (Interestingly, neither it nor the 1986-87 summary mentions the tragic death of Len Bias, who was the best hope to carry on the winning tradition from the Big Three.)\n\nBut that's all a prelude to the six complete games (plus one quarter) included in the set. It's a rare chance to see all-time great players such as Bill Russell, the Bird-Parish-McHale front line, and even a pre-TV-personality Bill Walton grabbing a key offensive rebound to remind everyone of the player he was before the injuries. It includes the aforementioned Phoenix Suns game, two games against the Magic-Kareem Lakers in 1984, a game against Houston's Twin Towers by the 1986 team that some call the best ever, and a 1987 game against Detroit that didn't lead to a championship but allowed Bird to create his own John Havlicek-esque moment.

In a revival of the leagueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest rivalry, the Celtics, led by Finals MVP Paul Pierce, prevailed over the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2008 NBA Finals in 6 games.\n\nAfter winning just 24 games in 2007, the Celtics transformed their franchise overnight with the bold acquisitions of perennial All-Stars Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen, who joined the teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long-time leader, Paul Pierce. Led by their new Big Three, Boston took the NBA by storm in the regular season, compiling a league-best 66 wins, the biggest single season turnaround in NBA history. In the playoffs, the Celtics reaffirmed their greatness with gruelling victories over the Atlanta Hawks, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Detroit Pistons, followed by a stirring triumph in the Finals over league MVP Kobe Bryant and the Lakers that included one of the greatest comebacks in NBA player history.\n\nRelive the CelticsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ historic regular season, their dramatic playoff run and their ultimate victory in the Finals. Watch it all from a courtside seat with spectacular highlights, exclusive interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, all on one action-packed DVD. Experience the NBAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most fabled franchiseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s return to basketball glory.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers @ Boston Celtics 2008 NBA Finals Game 1\nLos Angeles Lakers @ Boston Celtics 2008 NBA Finals Game 2\nBoston Celtics @ Los Angeles Lakers 2008 NBA Finals Game 4\nLos Angeles Lakers @ Boston Celtics 2008 NBA Finals Game 6\n\nDVD Infos:\nRipper: peacemaker30\nVideo: MPEG-PS, 720x480, 7295 Kbps, 29.97 fps\nAudio: AC-3, 192 Kbps, CBR, 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n2008 NBA Finals Infos:\nRipper group: CTU\nVideo: MPEG4 (H264), 1280x720, 4780 Kbps, 29.97 fps\nAudio: AC-3, 384 Kbps, 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nScreenshots:\n[img]http://bostonceltics.blogspot.si/files/2013/04/Boston-Garden.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://bostonceltics.blogspot.si/files/2013/04/Retired-Numbers.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://bostonceltics.blogspot.si/files/2013/04/Celtics-Players.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://bostonceltics.blogspot.si/files/2013/04/Inside-the-Garden.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://bostonceltics.blogspot.si/files/2013/04/NBA-2008-Champions.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://bostonceltics.blogspot.si/files/2013/04/2008-NBA-Finals-Game-6.jpg[/img]\n\nWhole album:\n[url]http://imgur.com/a/pIAOM[/url]\n\nUploader notes:\nI found this on the internet some while ago.
