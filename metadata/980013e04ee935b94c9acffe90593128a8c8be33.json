The story gathers strength with the entry, in the late nineteen-forties, of Robert Craft, a young conductor of overpowering ambition. Craft made Stravinsky's later works possible, patiently introducing him to twelve-tone music, and eventually became such an intimate that a breach with Stravinsky's children was inevitable. Negotiating the ensuing web of lawsuits, wounded egos, and tax-avoidance schemes, Walsh, an academic musicologist who writes with the verve of a first-rate critic, never loses sight of the incandescent figure at its center, a man whose supposedly inexpressive music became &quot;the best response to those terrifying years that brought it into being.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:980013e04ee935b94c9acffe90593128a8c8be33","amp;dn":"Stravinsky_The+Second+Exile%3A+France+and+America+1934+-1971+%5BNon-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"980013e04ee935b94c9acffe90593128a8c8be33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,0,19,224,78,233,53,185,76,154,207,254,144,89,49,40,168,200,190,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
