Ward navigates the change of early 20th century America on the wrong side of the law and society, his loyal friend, a freed slave named Christmas Moultrie, at his side. Master of Shakespeare, and the shotgun that provides SavannahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s markets with fowl, Ward fights for his rights as a hunter. His charisma and eloquent rhetoric win the heart of a society woman who defies her father to marry him. An elderly Moultrie tells the story of life on the river with his friend to a little boy, who passes the legendary Ward Allen down to the next generation.\n\nGenre:  Drama | Family | History\nIMDB Rating: 5.2/10 from 186 users Metascore: 25/100\nDirected by: Annette Haywood-Carter\nStarring: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jaimie Alexander, Jim Caviezel\n\nRelease Name: Savannah.2013.DVDRip.x264-IGUANA\nSize: 643 MB\nVideo: MKV | 720Ãƒâ€”304\nAudio: English | AAC | 160 kbps\nRuntime: 109 min\nSubtitle: N/A","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:988671b9c9bb9bd63183e383e3d739fca968102c","amp;dn":"+Savannah+2013+DVDRip+x264-IGUANA+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"988671b9c9bb9bd63183e383e3d739fca968102c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,134,113,185,201,187,155,214,49,131,227,131,227,215,57,252,169,104,16,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
