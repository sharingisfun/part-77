It is an adaptation of the final volume of In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust. The plot is about the anonymous narrator of In Search of Lost Time who reflects on his past experiences while lying on his deathbed.\nThe choice to develop the last volume of In Search of Lost Time allows the film to refer to the entire series of books. For example, the film shows an episode of the first novel, Swann's Way, usually referred to as &quot;the lady in pink&quot;, as a flashback of Time Regained.\nThe film was entered into the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Regained_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Regained_(film)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:992bff9453df8f94b5be59dcc2782c38f034ae7b","amp;dn":"Le+Temps+Retrouve.%281999+de++Ra%26uacute%3Bl+Ruiz%29.DVDRip.XVid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"992bff9453df8f94b5be59dcc2782c38f034ae7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,43,255,148,83,223,143,148,181,190,89,220,194,120,44,56,240,52,174,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
