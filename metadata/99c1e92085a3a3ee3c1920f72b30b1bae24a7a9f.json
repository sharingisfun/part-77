Although often read as a book of strange visions about the end of time, the book of Revelation is actually one of the most relevant books in the Bible for Christian faith in the twenty-first century. Evil and suffering are an unavoidable component of human experience and they generate a host of questions by those seeking to be faithful in the midst of such experiences. Why do Christians suffer? How are we to understand God's sovereignty in a world of injustice, violence, and opposition? What is the appropriate response of faith to such a world? In A SLAUGHTERED LAMB, Greg Stevenson argues that the book of Revelation addresses such questions and the tension that is created between our faith and our experiences of evil and suffering. Revelation is a book that reminds us that God is faithful to his creation, that challenges us to take up the call for faithful witness in a hostile world, and that reveals to us that GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s primary response to evil and suffering is to meet us in the form of a slaughtered lamb. A rich resource for pastors and ministry leaders as well as an accessible introduction to Revelation for the average reader.
