One day, he meets a mysterious girl named Amamiya Yuuko, who, to his surprise, recognizes him. Memories of a distant childhood, memories rather left forgotten...meeting Yuuko again will force Yuu to confront the regrets and sorrows of their collective pasts and presents.\n\nIn the present, Kuze Shuuichi may seem like a womanizer, but upon closer inspection, is a man who would rather be left alone. Hayama Mizuki, however, is not the type of girl who would let him be, especially after hearing the beautiful sounds of his violin performance. As Mizuki attempts to become closer to him, Kuze attempts to push her awayÃ¢â‚¬â€the tale of their budding relationship is darkened with undertones of an imminent tragedy.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------\nInformation:\nType: TV\nEpisodes: 12\nStatus: Finished Airing\nAired: Oct 7, 2008 to Dec 23, 2008\nProducers: Shaft, Sentai FilmworksL\nGenres: Mystery, Drama, Romance, Supernatural, Seinen\nDuration: 24 min. per episode\nRating: PG-13 - Teens 13 or older\n-------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------\nFile Information:\nFiles: 12\nFormat: Matroska (.MKV)\nFile Size: ~500mb per file\nSubtitles: English (Soft-subs)\nAudio Languages: 1.English, 2.Japanese.\n-------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nPS:I came across this anime torrent a while ago.\nAll credits go to dualaudioempire.com, please check out their website fro more.\nThere was no torrent in KAT.
