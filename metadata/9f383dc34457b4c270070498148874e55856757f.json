Three American soldiers, the survivors of a helicopter crash in Afghanistan, struggle across the Taliban-controlled mountains. Injured and lacking food, water, and medicine, they discover something far worse than enemy fighters among the sun-bleached rocks: an ancient supernatural power, murderous and unstoppable. Despite a timely rescue by a handful of British S.A.S. commandos, they're still hopelessly outnumbered by the shambling, ragged undead and the evil human intelligence that controls them.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded] - 2 Sisters (Matt Kindt) [GN]:\n\nthepiratebay.se/torrent/8916258\n\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - State of Decay OST (2013) - Jesper Kyd:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any question please feel free to ask! **\t \n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f383dc34457b4c270070498148874e55856757f","amp;dn":"Stitched+%28%2301-15%29+%28Garth+Ennis%29+%5BOngoing%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f383dc34457b4c270070498148874e55856757f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,56,61,195,68,87,180,194,112,7,4,152,20,136,116,229,88,86,117,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
