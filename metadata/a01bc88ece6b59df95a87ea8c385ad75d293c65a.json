SVG is a mature\nstandard, first released more than a decade ago and has been under improvement by\nthe W3C ever since. SVG is now available natively in all modern web browsers, as well\nas more than one billion mobile devices. SVG provides ways to create interactive graph-\nics that can be rescaled without loss of clarity. Like HTML and HTML5, SVG coexists\nhappily with technologies that are already familiar to web programmers, such as CSS,\nJavaScript, the Document Object Model, AJAX and, indeed, with HTML itself.\nThis book provides a comprehensive introduction to the language and how to use\nit for interaction and animation. The text also provides exposure to several important\nJavaScript packages and libraries, including D3, jQuery, and Pergola. While the book\ndoes not provide exhaustive coverage of every feature of the SVG language, it does\noffer essential guidance in using the key SVG components.\nIn addition to its coverage of basic SVG features, the book discusses a wide range\nof software tools for creating SVG and for embellishing it with scripted functionality.\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also find solid introductions to complex topics such as SVG animation and filters.\nIn many places, the book includes step by step examples and references numerous\nexamples and downloadable sample projects that you can explore for yourself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a01bc88ece6b59df95a87ea8c385ad75d293c65a","amp;dn":"building+web+applications+with+svg+%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+Torrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a01bc88ece6b59df95a87ea8c385ad75d293c65a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,27,200,142,206,107,89,223,149,168,126,168,195,133,173,117,210,147,198,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
