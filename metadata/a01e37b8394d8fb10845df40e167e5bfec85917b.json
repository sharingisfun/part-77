Ready to downsize and motivated to sell, BradÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treasure-filled collection is a bonanza of rare Canadiana, including a pricey narwhal tusk and an unmentionable walrus part. In EdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s motorcycle garage in Havelock, Scott and Sheldon strike a classic Easy Rider pose on two legendary bikes. And when Scott asks Ed to build him one, he learns how expensive legends can be. Outside Campbellford, a father and son team have an awesome collection, but their prices are through the roof. Back at home, Keenan leaves the guys in the lurch to pursue his boxing career, so they call in a friend who proves to be a whiz at sales. Country singer George Canyon calls with a special request for his new ranchhouse and challenges the guys to a wager they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a01e37b8394d8fb10845df40e167e5bfec85917b","amp;dn":"Canadian+Pickers-Bad+to+the+Bone.S04e01.HDwebrip-BeechyBoy.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a01e37b8394d8fb10845df40e167e5bfec85917b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,30,55,184,57,77,143,177,8,69,223,64,225,103,229,191,236,133,145,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
