My name is Casey Kasem and our countdown rolls on.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThe band that recorded &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; lost a member and reformed under a new name. They finally have a song in the countdown that isn't annoying.\n\nThere is a band in the countdown that is enjoying their sixth million selling album.\n\nThere is a song in the countdown by the former rock 'n' roll star whose name inspired the fictional name of Conrad Birdie, the title character in the hit Broadway musical and motion picture, &quot;Bye Bye Birdie.&quot;\n\nMaureen McGovern is at number 26 with her first hit song, &quot;The Morning After&quot; from the motion picture, &quot;The Poseidon Adventure.&quot;\n\nThere's a group in the countdown who just a few weeks prior, played to a crowd of 600,000 people. That's 1/350th of the US population at the time.\n\nThere is a woman on the chart who, just a week prior, helped break the record for most female singers hitting number one in a single year. The previous record stood for twenty one years. Casey gives the details.\n\n40:    Get It Together - The Jackson Five\n39:    In The Midnight Hour - Cross Country\n38:    To Know You Is To Love You - B.B.
