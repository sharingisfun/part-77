An investigation into the origins - and present-day activities - of the ethnic gangs that turned criminal activities into family enterprises, The Real Godfathers exposes an underworld of danger, money, glamour and murder, covering such notorious figures as Al Capone, Lucky Luciano, Carlo Gambino and John Gotti, as well as topics including the bloody mob wars , the ordinary, privileged, and at times remarkable women who gained stature in a male-dominated world, and the gangster-turned-informants who make it possible to prosecute the Mafia.\n\n9)  Joe Bonanno \nJoe Bonanno's life spans almost a century of Mafia history. Born into a prominent Mafia family in Sicily, and a founding member of the original Mafia commission in 1931--Joe witnessed the rise and fall of a secret, violent world and lived to tell the tale. For thirty years he quietly built a Mafia family dynasty--his name never even mentioned in the papers. When Bonanno presided over the wedding of his son Bill to Rosalie Profaci--the niece of one of the other New York City godfathers--Joe was arguably the most powerful Mafia chieftain in the world. Then, in the early sixties, his world went spiraling out of control. Joe moved his son Bill into a leadership position in the Family, and the commission he had founded turned against him. Bill Bonanno could not be the man his father had been because times had changed. With former family members trying to kill him on one side--and law enforcement hounding him on the other--Bill had inherited a sinking ship. In less than a decade, kidnapping, betrayal and murder ultimately forced the Bonanno godfather and his son into exile. Remarkably, Joe Bonanno outlived all of his enemies. In 1983, he became the first and only godfather to publish his memoirs.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/3985/xukr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/3985/xukr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4483/7mum.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4483/7mum.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/3231/trla.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/3231/trla.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/1442/v447.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/1442/v447.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/980/ibu7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/980/ibu7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/3154/k7s2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/3154/k7s2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/7158/5a0i.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/7158/5a0i.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/7156/tg8l.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/7156/tg8l.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/6573/zvak.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/6573/zvak.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/2259/42h5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/2259/42h5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/2496/4f8b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/2496/4f8b.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/235/wx2i.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/235/wx2i.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/9023/pvyq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/9023/pvyq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/2184/y95s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/2184/y95s.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/7896/n1da.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/7896/n1da.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/3658/suwl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/3658/suwl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2042 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x544\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.324:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 43min - 1hour 30min\nNumber Of Parts: 9\nPart Size: 700 MB - 1.45 GB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Real_Godfathers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Real_Godfathers&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a02897c72955e68aa52210a56fbb4237d8352055","amp;dn":"A%26amp%3BE+The+Real+Godfathers+9of9+Joe+Bonanno+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a02897c72955e68aa52210a56fbb4237d8352055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,40,151,199,41,85,230,138,165,34,16,165,111,187,66,55,216,53,32,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
