In addition to creating a unique musical sound, he has won praise for his power as a lyricist. His precisely worded narratives, with their sense of humour about daily life, stand as metaphors for the social and economic ills that bedevil his country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0373effe496f48544f41f99c33ba2b24775c8c8","amp;dn":"Oliver+Mutukudzi_tsimba","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0373effe496f48544f41f99c33ba2b24775c8c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,55,62,255,228,150,244,133,68,244,31,153,195,59,162,178,71,117,200,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
