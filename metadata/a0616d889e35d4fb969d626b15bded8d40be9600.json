I think they finally realized that those demands were going to blow up in their faces. Now, if nothing else, at least theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to shield their faces. Now theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for a fallback strategy. Guys, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re supposed to have a fallback plan well before you start actually falling. Obama won. Now he just has to find a way to allow Republicans to tell their base that they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lose.\n\nNow the Republicans have a new strategy... or at least, a new way of approaching the fact that they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a strategy. Republicans are offering a plan for a very temporary increase in the debt ceiling. In other words, they reserve the right to engage in hostage taking in the future... and the near future, at that. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not clear how long a debt ceiling increase would be. Republicans have mentioned things like 4 to 6 weeks. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not increasing the debt ceiling, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s merely propping up the debt ceiling. A short-term debt limit increase! Thanks guysÃ¢â‚¬â€youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re offering to trade a state of acute crisis for a state of chronic crisis. They also want to concentrate on continuing the government shutdown. I think thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the RepublicansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ idea of compromiseÃ¢â‚¬â€they wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep the government going, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re willing to keep the government shutdown going.\n\nThe Koch brothers disassociated themselves from the efforts to destroy Obamacare... The Koch brothers created this crisis! For them to try and step away from it is like water trying to disassociate itself from a flood. If the Koch brothers and Heritage are saying that the debt ceiling shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be tied to defunding Obamacare, then what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re really saying is that it just didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work.\n\nRepublican Congressman Markwayne Mullin has issued a call for all FOUR branches of the government to work together. Hey, Markwayne is a guy who forgot to leave a space between his two first names. Mullin is quoted as saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“This country isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ran by just one individual itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ran by four branches, but three branches that are in control of this.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ What?!? If thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the actual quote, then Mullin getting the wrong number of branches is the least of his problems!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0616d889e35d4fb969d626b15bded8d40be9600","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+October+10+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0616d889e35d4fb969d626b15bded8d40be9600","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,97,109,136,158,53,212,251,150,157,98,107,21,189,237,141,64,190,150,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
