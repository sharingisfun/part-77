For the first time, only original colour footage is used to paint a vividly detailed picture of these closely allied nations, from the build up to World War Two to the end of the Vietnam conflict. Newly discovered films and home movies along with diary and letter extracts allow viewers a very personal connection with the war experience, both on the battlefield and on the homefront. In colour, that shared history becomes even more intimate and involving. Narrated by Russell Crowe, this powerful and moving three-part series captures the thoughts and feelings of ordinary people caught up in world-shattering events.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0a2e80294fd57d6349fce22508f759705de5ae3","amp;dn":"Colour+Of+War+-+The+ANZACS.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0a2e80294fd57d6349fce22508f759705de5ae3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,162,232,2,148,253,87,214,52,159,206,34,80,143,117,151,5,222,90,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
