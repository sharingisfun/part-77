Two demo CDs were recorded respectively in February 2001 and December 2002. The latter drew the attention of Red Stream Inc. who released in May 2003 the first official Mirrorthrone album entitled &quot;Of Wind and Weeping&quot;, a collection of early recording and demo tracks. This debut CD got an overall positive welcome from the specialized press and other music enthusiasts worldwide.

Songwriting this good should be punishable by law.Talking about individual songs here almost seems a bit silly, as the whole thing flows like a symphony made by some sort of insanity-ridden cacodaemon, but I'm going to give it a shot anyway: The first song is titled &quot;Dismay,&quot; and it starts off with a piano melody so beautiful that I was actually sort of disappointed when everything got distorted and the harsh, rasping vocals came in, but the song is a good one, towering high and carrying itself majestically through a wasteland of blackened filth. &quot;No One By My Side&quot; ups the ante, as it is even better, with a more epic and theatrical feel to it, and &quot;The Fecal Rebellion&quot; is the best on here, fifteen minutes long and absolutely wonderful, with great faster sections and some killer, almost proggy, licks here and there, all combining with the symphonic nature of the music with class and style to spare.
