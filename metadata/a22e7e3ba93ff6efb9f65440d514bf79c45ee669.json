We'll then create an appealing final video using a few simple images and a variety of compositing and animation techniques. We'll begin this project by importing our elements and tracking various features of the face. Once we have a base of tracking data to work off of, we'll learn the basic math terms and ideas that we will use to translate our 2D tracker data into 3D rotation. We'll then learn how to take our mathematical equation, and translate it into an expression NUKE understands. Once we have our rotation expressions working, we'll finish our 2d elements using a variety of color correction, masking and animation techniques. Then we'll combine all our nodes using compositing math to correctly mix everything together.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://assets.digitaltutors.com/dtv_/bison_courses/284/assets/284-banner_1040.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://assets.digitaltutors.com/dtv_/bison_courses/284/assets/284-banner_1040.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a22e7e3ba93ff6efb9f65440d514bf79c45ee669","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+3D+Rotation+with+Trackers+and+Trigonometry+in+Nuk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a22e7e3ba93ff6efb9f65440d514bf79c45ee669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,46,126,59,169,63,246,239,185,246,84,64,213,20,191,121,196,94,230,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
