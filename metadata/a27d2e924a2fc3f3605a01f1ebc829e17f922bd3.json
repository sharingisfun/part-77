They are not Legion, They are Lesion.\n\n- X-Sect have interviewed in the media as apparent spokesmen of Anonymous, dis-\n  crediting #ops with unproven conspiracy theories and then dangerously leaking\n  sensitive info obtained about operations and who is involved in them. For What?\n\n- They associate themselves with Anonymous, using logos, the name, video content\n  and graphics. Modifying the work of others to add their own logo, propaganda and\n  disinfo, then releasing the work as their own to blend in with other Ã¢â‚¬Å“secÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n- Selling Ã¢â‚¬Å“AnonymousÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ merchandise and accepting donations in the name of Anonymous \n  while they are no longer welcome and have never participated in Anonymous Ops.\n\n- Attacking and doxing innocent people and families, posting pictures of underage\n  children with derogatory remarks in public to intimidate their parents. \n\n- Creating websites, pastebins, and full pages of slander to intimidate and extort\n  silence out of those who wish to expose them. Including claims of Ã¢â‚¬Å“pedophiliaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n- Repeatedly plead with authorities and file reports on individuals who have made\n  fun of them or Anonymous as a whole for Ã¢â‚¬Å“harassmentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½,Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cyber-StalkingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½,Ã¢â‚¬Å“hackingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n  and worse. There are never any charges brought due to lack of proof, however this\n  gives justification for surveillance of targets and could potentially expose ops.  \n\n- Creating petitions against Anonymous #Ops, Petitions to investigate specific\n  accounts with claims they should be deleted. Arranging teams of users who are\n  willing to mass Ã¢â‚¬Å“dislikeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“report for abuseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ various videos, profiles on\n  social networking sites, pastebin documents, email accounts, etc. #big0try.\n\n- Turning anons against one another with falsified evidence, fake accounts, and\n  threats of demotion. Distracting Anons from important issues and ops while those\n  on the outside see Anonymous as mindless conspiracy nuts with cult-like behavior.\n##############################################################################","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a27d2e924a2fc3f3605a01f1ebc829e17f922bd3","amp;dn":"%23OpDemask2+-+Unmasking+X-SECT+-+Media+Files+%28Video%2FAudio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a27d2e924a2fc3f3605a01f1ebc829e17f922bd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,125,46,146,74,47,195,243,96,90,1,241,235,200,41,225,127,146,43,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
