The series follows time-displaced samurai warrior &quot;Jack&quot; (voiced by Phil LaMarr) in his singular quest to find a method of traveling back in time and defeating the tyrannical demonic wizard Aku (voiced by Mako). Episode plots range from dark and epic to lighthearted and comic, but often contain little dialogue. Stories instead rely on the series' highly detailed, outline-free, masking-based animation, as well as its cinematic style and pacing. Many battle scenes in the series are reminiscent of samurai films, and since Jack's robot enemies bleed out oil or electricity and his monster and alien foes bleed out slime or goo, the action of these films can be exhibited while avoiding censorship for blood and violence.weki","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2a0002a6ac43bc46369c04eee40b6c16cbefbc2","amp;dn":"Samurai+Jack+Complete+all+4+Seasons+with+extras%28MKV%29+--SPIDAROT+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2a0002a6ac43bc46369c04eee40b6c16cbefbc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,160,0,42,106,196,59,196,99,105,192,78,238,64,182,193,108,190,251,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
