What first looks like a typical after-hours pub brawl gone seriously wrong soon becomes more complex and more sinister. The victim, Jason Fox, was a member of a white power organization known as the Albion League, and had recently been let go from his factory job because of his racist views.\n\nSo who was his killer? The Pakistani youths he had insulted in the pub earlier that evening? The shady friends of his business partner, Mark Wood? Or could it have been someone from the organization who was concerned with Jason's growing power?\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Alan Banks and Detective Constable Susan Gay must struggle with a case complicated by escalating racial tensions and simmering departmental politics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a37f83e4bf2f1514984e98daedd50efbad8a99ff","amp;dn":"Dead+Right","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a37f83e4bf2f1514984e98daedd50efbad8a99ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,127,131,228,191,47,21,20,152,78,152,218,237,213,14,251,173,138,153,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
