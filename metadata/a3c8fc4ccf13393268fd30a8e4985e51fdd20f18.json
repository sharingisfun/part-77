But instead of rushing her to the hospital, Liz's savior abducts her to his remote farmhouse, convinced that she is the wife who abandoned him years earlier. Cut off from civilization, kept prisoner and guarded day and night by vicious attack dogs, Liz realizes she must rely on her skills as a con artist to talk her way out of this hostage situation. In the satiric tradition of Buffalo '66, Misery, Black Snake Moan, and Secretary, comes this captivating black comedy about the ties that bind.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img842/5809/wq89.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img842/5809/wq89.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img547/9013/1lhr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img547/9013/1lhr.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img18/1562/ymbl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img18/1562/ymbl.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img824/38/6ol6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img824/38/6ol6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3c8fc4ccf13393268fd30a8e4985e51fdd20f18","amp;dn":"Puppy+2005+xvid+mp4+-+sum1_here+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3c8fc4ccf13393268fd30a8e4985e51fdd20f18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,200,252,76,207,19,57,50,104,253,48,168,228,152,94,81,253,210,15,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
