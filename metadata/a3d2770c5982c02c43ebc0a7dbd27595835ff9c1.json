Again it worked! And even if many people would hesitate to plug this weird looking but familiar plug, I can assure you it works with no risks on jamming inside your portable audio device.\n\nAnyway, the sound quality is very nice against all expectations but will necessitate a power amplifier to be louder when using only portable sources like pods or phones.\n\nThe files are open to anyone who wantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to try to make a pair of these!\n\nmy website and email for additional info:\n\nkarich.cl\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;066f686069466d67746f656e6263756f61682865696b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3d2770c5982c02c43ebc0a7dbd27595835ff9c1","amp;dn":"Low+Fi+High+Tech+Headphone+3D+printed+karich+design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3d2770c5982c02c43ebc0a7dbd27595835ff9c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,210,119,12,89,130,192,44,67,235,192,167,219,210,117,149,131,95,249,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
