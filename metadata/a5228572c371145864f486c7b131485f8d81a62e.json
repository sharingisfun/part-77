It was always better to be seen, not heard. And while a theatric streak and friendly demeanor might have fooled most people, he knew the truthÃ¢â‚¬â€he was the shy one. The quiet kid most people forgot about. Some might have considered that a bad thing, but those people all wanted to be in the spotlight.\nThe only place Carter didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind attention was on stage, with The Hellions. Once content in his comfort zone in Seattle, Washington, he only knew three things: confrontation was to be avoided, keeping the peace was priority, and the moment he lost Kate Parker to Professor Ryan Campbell, he had no clue what to do with his life. Playing gigs, working at Pike Place Market, and watching BBC after the love of his life sailed off into the sunset just wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to cut it anymore.\nDesperate to escape his rut, he takes a cue from Kate and chooses a random place to relocateÃ¢â‚¬â€a small island across the country, where no one knows his name and memories of unrequited love arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t found at every turn. Just when he thinks heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s found the perfect place to unwind and sink back into the shadows, in bursts Whitney Sinclair, a saucy firecracker who loves life and refuses to settle for second best. Full of contagious energy, she dares him to be brave, convincing him that it might finally be time to tell the world what he wants.\nIt might be time to make a declaration.\n\nGenre: Romance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5228572c371145864f486c7b131485f8d81a62e","amp;dn":"Rachael+Wade+-+Declaration+%28Preservation+%233%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5228572c371145864f486c7b131485f8d81a62e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,34,133,114,195,113,20,88,100,244,134,199,177,49,72,95,141,129,166,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
