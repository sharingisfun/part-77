Certain models reappear throughout the book as running themes to synthesize different concepts from multiple angles, and a dynamical systems focus emphasizes predicting the long-term behavior of these recurring models. Users will discover how to identify and harness the mathematics they will use in their careers, and apply it effectively outside the classroom.\n\nProduct Identifiers\nISBN-10\t0495561983\nISBN-13\t9780495561989\n\nKey Details\nAuthor\tGlen R.
