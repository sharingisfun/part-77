It is complete except for the encore which was &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;.\n\nWhile available as silver boot press, these files were made from the master that was used to produce the silver, so I thought I'd post them. My source has asked to remain nameless. \n\nThis was an informal ftp trade, so I don't know how it was transferred to HD, but the rest of the lineage info is completely accurate. There were no ffp files so I created some. Sorry if this has already been here or if there is something left out. I don't upload much. I have a pretty large Sabbath collection and am thinking of upping some of the gems that I have. \n\nThere is no artwork for this particular version, but the artwork for the silver version is up at sabbathlive.com\n \nDisc 1\nIntro-Supertzar \nTime Machine\nChildren Of The Grave\nChildren Of The Sea \nI Witness \nThe Mob Rules \nInto The Void \nPsychophobia \n\nDisc2\nBlack Sabbath \nNeon Knights\nImmaculate Deception\nThe Wizard\nCross Of Thorns\nDrum Solo\nSymptom Of The Universe\nHeadless Cross \nParanoid ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5bf4fc2757f8673ee25fac837f593d3c58f3ee2","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath++1994-02-08++New+Britain%2C+CT+USA+%28SBD%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5bf4fc2757f8673ee25fac837f593d3c58f3ee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,191,79,194,117,127,134,115,238,37,250,200,55,245,147,211,197,143,62,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
