Aurora beta)\nINSTALL $ BOOT CD\nENGLISH\n------------------------------\n\nOS/2 is a computer operating system, initially created by Microsoft and IBM, then later developed by IBM exclusively. The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a620f56f19ab32c58c3b2f343582fb813e441fb1","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+Server+for+e-Business+4.50+Beta+-+14.020F_UNI+-+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a620f56f19ab32c58c3b2f343582fb813e441fb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,32,245,111,25,171,50,197,140,59,47,52,53,130,251,129,62,68,31,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
