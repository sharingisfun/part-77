As he stares up, people stream past, walking silently toward the enormous ships, which emit a persistent noise. Only Sam seems immune to the signal. Six months later, he is absolutely alone.\n\nOr so he thinks. Because after he emerges from his underground bunker and is wounded by a flying drone, a hail of machine-gun fire ultimately reveals two very important truths: One, Sam is not, in fact, alone. And two, the drone injury should have killed himÃ¢â‚¬â€but it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.\n\nWith his home planet feeling alien and the future unstable and unclear, Sam must navigate a new world in this gripping adventure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7479f6a164ea2bb2214091cff238aac74431853","amp;dn":"Earthfall+-+Mark+Walden.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7479f6a164ea2bb2214091cff238aac74431853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,71,159,106,22,78,162,187,34,20,9,28,255,35,138,172,116,67,24,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
