Anatomy of an Apple is an engaging and knowledgeable romp through technology history. Anatomy of an Apple takes us on a journey through the highs and lows of Steve's fascinating life across several businesses, including Apple, NeXT, and Pixar.\n\nHow these two entities, Steve the man, and Apple the company, healed each other, is well worth learning. They began bruised and battered, and became a thriving partnership. Applying those elements to your own situations and challenges, is the way to personally reach the next level.\n\nSteveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach to solving challenges is what Anatomy of an Apple is about. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also about what happens when you relentlessly pursue quality and principle. Steve Jobs wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t superhuman. He had personal flaws. He made mistakes. That makes his achievements all the more impressive. In the end, what really matters to history, and to the world at large, is what he was committed to, passionate about and worked for. \n\nThe results speak for themselves.\n\n* It's on sale on iTunes &amp; Amazon. IMHO it's worth buying. This is a PDF, btw.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8175e47869ce641c3b9b84b50a52aa451c31d2c","amp;dn":"Anatomy+of+an+Apple+-+The+Lessons+Steve+Taught+Us","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8175e47869ce641c3b9b84b50a52aa451c31d2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,23,94,71,134,156,230,65,195,185,184,75,80,165,42,164,81,195,29,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
