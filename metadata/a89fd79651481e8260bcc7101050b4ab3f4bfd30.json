This is 100% untouched. These are a copy from a computer that has a working and updating installation.  I am posting this due to anyone having problems downloading, crashing, getting hash errors etc etc. This will will fix those problems. \n\n\nPretty simple.\n\nCopy Piranah Games Folder to your installation folder already on your computer overwriting any existing files. You must have the launcher at least installed to work.  If you don't have it, the current launcher is included. \n\nYour orginal game folder, should be in c://progam files(x86)/piranah games\n\nGame as of October 7, 2013.
