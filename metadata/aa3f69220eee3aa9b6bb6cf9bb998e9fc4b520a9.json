Wells, before becoming a vehicle for a supernatural action series starring an original character, the Living Mummy.\n\nSupernatural Thrillers ran 15 issues (Dec. 1972 - Oct. 1975). The title was one of four launched by Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Roy Thomas to form a line of science fiction and horror anthologies with more thematic cohesiveness than the company's earlier attempts that decade,[1] which had included the series Chamber of Darkness and Tower of Shadows. Whereas those titles generally presented original stories, these new books would instead adapt genre classics and other stories.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa3f69220eee3aa9b6bb6cf9bb998e9fc4b520a9","amp;dn":"Marvel+Supernatural+Thrillers+%281972-75%29+1-15+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa3f69220eee3aa9b6bb6cf9bb998e9fc4b520a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,63,105,34,14,238,58,169,182,187,108,249,187,153,142,159,196,181,32,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
