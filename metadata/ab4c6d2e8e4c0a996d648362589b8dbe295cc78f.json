Released in 1992, five years after his self-titled debut solo album.\n\nAfter A View from Third Street, Jude Cole shifted to a more heartland rock sound. Nowhere is that more evident than the disc's title song first track, a combination of Springsteen/Mellencamp that rocks more than his previous two albums. It features the polished heartbreak of &quot;Tell the Truth&quot;, the sad sack story of &quot;First Your Money&quot; and the been-there, done-that weary world of &quot;A Place in the Line&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab4c6d2e8e4c0a996d648362589b8dbe295cc78f","amp;dn":"Jude+Cole+-+Start+The+Car+%5B1992%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab4c6d2e8e4c0a996d648362589b8dbe295cc78f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,76,109,46,142,76,10,153,109,100,131,98,88,155,141,190,41,92,199,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
