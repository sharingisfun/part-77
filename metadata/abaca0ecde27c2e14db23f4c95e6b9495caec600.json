Yet when homicide detective Danny Martell arrives on the scene, he finds the victims have been elaborately made up, with fabric wings attached to their lifeless bodies. The papers have dubbed the killings Ã‚Â¿the Angel MurdersÃ‚Â¿ - but it isnÃ‚Â¿t long before the crime wave drags Danny into his own personal hell.\n\nSoon after the killings begin, Danny's wife, Linda, abruptly disappears. And when his worst fears are realized, a grief-stricken Danny doubles down on his hunt for the deranged serial killer. But was Linda just a random angel? Or was she targeted by a copycat killer with a vendetta against Danny? He vows to uncover the truth, no matter the cost. After all, he has nothing left to lose.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abaca0ecde27c2e14db23f4c95e6b9495caec600","amp;dn":"Howard+Kaminsky+-+Angel+Wings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abaca0ecde27c2e14db23f4c95e6b9495caec600","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,172,160,236,222,39,194,225,77,178,63,76,149,230,185,73,92,174,198,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
