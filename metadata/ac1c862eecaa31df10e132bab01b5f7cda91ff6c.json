Daf's girlfriend expects a ring and to spend Christmas with her parents, his Mum wants him to scatter his recently deceased Dad's ashes on Snowdon, his ex-girlfriend is still in his life, his sister is still upset at her Dad's death..... and that's just the first 10 minutes.\n\nChaos ensues, with car breakdowns, people being stuck in the mountains, a surprise announcement and much more. All harmless fun......","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac1c862eecaa31df10e132bab01b5f7cda91ff6c","amp;dn":"Driving+Home+for+Christmas+-+Radio+Drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac1c862eecaa31df10e132bab01b5f7cda91ff6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,28,134,46,236,170,49,223,16,225,50,186,176,27,95,124,218,145,255,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
