He is also the founding Pastor of Times Square Church in New York City, an interdenominational church, and President of World Challenge, Inc.  Wilkerson's sermons are known for being direct and frank. He emphasizes Christian beliefs, such as: God's holiness and righteousness, God's love towards humans and especially Christian views of Jesus. Wilkerson tries to avoid categorizing Christians into distinct groups according to the parish they belong to, and as such he is considered by many to be a truly ecumenical evangelist.\n\nGod had a plan that you and I would not only survive but that we would be more than over comers. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter how wicked the world becomes and what the devil brings on society Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we have abiding in us a power that is greater than any other power. This power is the Holy Spirit!! You have not fully received the Holy Spirit until you allow Him to do what He was sent to do. We are to cast every burden on Him Ã¢â‚¬â€œHE is the Burden Bearer. As we turn every burden over to Him Ã¢â‚¬â€œ We are receiving Him.  David Wilkerson's powerful preaching against the Great Apostasy taking root in the Church in these last days.\n\nIncluded Sermons:\nBy Now You Ought To Be Teachers\nDont Judge By Your Feelings - Part 1&amp;2\nGods People Will Never Be Ashamed\nMen of Another Sort\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac3a2fefa2633dbe6f685f24d64c06c4b10e13ec","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+The+Word+-+030+-+David+Wilkerson+-+Dont+Judge+By+Your+Fe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac3a2fefa2633dbe6f685f24d64c06c4b10e13ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,58,47,239,162,99,61,190,111,104,95,36,214,76,6,196,177,14,19,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
