Where else can you go from Ravi Shankar, Alan Jackson, Ali Farka TourÃƒÂ©, Alejandro Fernandez, Karaj Iran, and finish with Dead Sara. MMR plays KISS for our classic rockers, Chris Martin for the Yardie Shottas, MBLAQ for the K-Poppers, and the Geto Boys for real Hip Hoppers.\n\nAs a member of the Mint Music Artist Competition &amp; Social Network, your audio content is eligible to be played on Mint Music Radio.
