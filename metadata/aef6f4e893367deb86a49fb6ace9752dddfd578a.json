These calls are also a way for the general public to ask Nassim questions regarding any subject they wish. \n\nThese collected works are a wonderful alternative to mainstream media and can alter the way you function in this Universe (if you so wish). \n\nPlease consider making a donation or becoming a member at The Resonance Project Foundation, a 501c3 organization dedicated to awakening the master in YOU.
