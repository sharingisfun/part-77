Guitarist Frisby and drummer Traynor found singer Craig Mabbitt and bassist Jared Warth on the local baby-band circuit and formed blessthefall in early 2004. Following a self-released three-song demo in the summer of 2005, guitarist Eric Lambert completed the final lineup of the band. An increased local live presence, including many shows played with fellow Phoenicians Greeley Estates, brought blessthefall to the attention of Greeley Estates' label, Science Records (an imprint of Record Collection), which signed the still largely teenaged band in 2006. Shows with bands like Norma Jean and Alesana followed before blessthefall's debut album, His Last Walk, surfaced in April 2007.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b03fe195a454d9cd4a6bf496b9936642d465cdf8","amp;dn":"blessthefall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b03fe195a454d9cd4a6bf496b9936642d465cdf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,63,225,149,164,84,217,205,74,107,244,150,185,147,102,66,212,101,205,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
