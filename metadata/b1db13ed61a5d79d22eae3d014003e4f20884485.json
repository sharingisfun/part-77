Outside the ring, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his heart that takes the shot.\nHe has fallen head over heels in love with the perfect woman.\nShe knows all about the wrestling life, the people in it, and what\nit takes to succeed. She is his best friend, and the one person he\nis not able to have.\n\nNoelle Reid plays by the rules. She is not the type to invite drama\ninto her life, and when her father has told her from the time she\nfirst discovered boys that she is not to date a pro wrestler, sheÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs\nnever questioned it. Then Jackson starts getting her heart beating\nfaster, and stealing every thought she had. She finds herself falling\nfor him, the forbidden pro-wrestler, her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (the former pro-\nwrestler himself) student. She can no longer lie to herself when she\nsays that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t love Jackson, because he is perfect\nfor her in every way.\n\nThe straight laced, daddyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s girl has grown up and is realizing that\nsome rules are going to be broken. Especially when her not so\ntrusting heart, begins to trust Jackson. She never trusted anyone\nbesides her father. And for the first time she starts to question why\nher father is so against his daughters getting involved with a man in\nthe profession he has loved his whole life. So Noelle has to decide on\nbeing the perfect daughter that she has always been, or finally put\nherself and her life first and allow herself to love Jackson.\n\n\n\n\nPerfect Match\n\nBy: Kelly Arlia\nPages: 773\nLanguage: EN\nFormat: PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1db13ed61a5d79d22eae3d014003e4f20884485","amp;dn":"Perfect+Match+-+Kelly+Arlia.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1db13ed61a5d79d22eae3d014003e4f20884485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,219,19,237,97,165,215,157,34,234,227,208,20,0,62,79,32,136,68,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
