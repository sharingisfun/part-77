Already the first Indie Playlist of November 2013. A special list. Sometimes that happens. I have to warn you though for the last track. There is a warning outstanding. I would not play it in public (my first time, something is on the list, I would not love to play in public). But in a way its a very interesting peace of music.... Enjoy, \n\nPS: Thanks Jamal for Kiddo. She balanced painting the list (and everybody else, for the rest :)).\n\n\n~@~ Indie 1311 I2 Stay With Me (Easy Rock)\n\n 01 Over The Rhine - The King Knows How\n 02 Kiddo - Lost Memory\n 03 Lhasa - Where Do You Go\n 04 Trampled By Turtles - Midnight On The Interstate\n 05 Wax Tailor - Dragon Chasers (Feat Charlotte Savary)\n 06 Young Summer - Waves That Rolled You Under\n 07 Kiddo - Hell &amp; Paradise\n 08 Kiddo - Walking On A Dream\n 09 Satellite Stories - Campfire\n 10 Charlotte Hatherley - Alexander\n 11 Little Birdy - Brother\n 12 Wildcat!
