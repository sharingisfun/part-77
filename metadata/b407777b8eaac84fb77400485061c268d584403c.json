Gradually she evolved into a confidante who remained with him until his death four years later. In this book she records Nixon's assessments of world events and world leaders, both as he sat brooding over his papers and draft memoirs, and during his almost manic peregrinations around the world. Ultimately the shadow of Watergate hung over his every moment, leading to revelations which startled the young Crowley. This portrait of an enigmatic and reviled former US President reveals him discussing international affairs at length; he is also seen as an aged widower cooking spaghetti for himself, reflecting on scandal, ageing and dying, and craving the company of the young researcher to whom he can pontificate and with whom he can keep his faculties alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b407777b8eaac84fb77400485061c268d584403c","amp;dn":"Monica+Crowley+-+Nixon+in+Winter+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b407777b8eaac84fb77400485061c268d584403c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,7,119,123,142,170,200,79,183,116,0,72,80,97,194,104,213,132,64,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
