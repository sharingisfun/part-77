Blaylock, about Coca-Cola's recent move to defend the cancer causing artificial sweeter aspartame claiming it makes you &quot;skinny.&quot; Dr. Blaylock has authored a number of books and papers including Natural Strategies for Cancer Patients and writes a monthly newsletter called the Blaylock Wellness Report. \n\nAmerican broadcaster and filmmaker Max Keiser will be on today's show to discuss worries that the central bank could taper its $85 billion a month in quantitative easing as early as September, spurring a huge sell-off in bonds possibly leading us into a major stock market decline. \n\nAlex will also address the continued unrest unfolding in Egypt that could potentially lead to World War III.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
