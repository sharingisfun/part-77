The animals that survived adapted and evolved thereafter.   Some developed language and created their own cities and communities, while others remained behind on the evolutionary scale.  Because of the vastness between the cities and towns it was much more difficult to communicate and travel, so much of the animals and amphibians stayed close together. \n\nThe main character, Flynn, a red eyed tree frog, resides in a small city beside a pond.  He lives and works as an engineer for the city council.   \n\nThe story begins when Flynn's beloved wife becomes ill after eating a mosquito that carried a disease called Triladectomia.  In order to save her, Flynn must travel out of the city and into the wilderness to find a cure.  In doing so he encounters numerous friends and enemies along the way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b718005c2bc3e95fbe1f802060c49c4ef68db1c3","amp;dn":"Flynn%3A+A+Frog%27s+Journey+E-Book+by+Andrew+Knight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b718005c2bc3e95fbe1f802060c49c4ef68db1c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,24,0,92,43,195,233,95,190,31,128,32,96,196,156,78,246,141,177,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
