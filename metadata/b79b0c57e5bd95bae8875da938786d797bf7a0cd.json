They arrived late and to be honest I could not ask them to close the - already long - row. So I had the reshuffle the row a bit, to reassign a more logical place. No one expects to find Simon &amp; Garfunkel at the bottom.\n\nA lot of work. However, music is a living thing and so some of the other portraits had already undergone some make over. And ordered in five more or less matching rows, it all makes more sense now. So its not too bad to download it again.\n\nAt the other hand, you cannot keep maintaining things for ever. Sometimes its time for something new. So this must be really it. A kind of sketch of old and new Pop Music in 75 Portraits (about 10% I portrayed). All in the best MP3 (unfortunately?) tracks I could find and all ordered (so you can play it as a real Playlist).\n\nDon't be angry if your favorite Band or Song is missing (You are free to add and delete if you wish. If I could, I would have done that already.). I just tried to relive all performed songs as if I would play and sing it myself.\n\nThe songs in which I could radiate the most energy and I was quite sure the original artists would like to be portrayed (Sound), I selected. And ordered the songs like a personal concert, valid for as many people as possible.\n\nI hope the Artists and You can appreciate it.... Enjoy (and listen to these girls and boys; they really have something to say)\n\nPS: I still looking for the two last candidates for my Exceptional Misfits series. Three I have already: Mike Old Field, N.E.R.D. and Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson. Suggestions? ABBA?\n\n\nDutch Treat B011-015 (5 Top Artists)\n\nB011 Rocket Man (Elton John)\n\n 01 Elton John - Funeral For A Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)\n 02 Elton John - Honky Cat\n 03 Elton John - Sacrifice\n 04 Elton John - Nikita\n 05 Elton John - Blessed\n 06 Elton John - Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\n 07 Elton John - Sixty Years On\n 08 Elton John - First Episode At Hienton\n 09 Elton John - Rocket Man\n 10 Elton John - Levon\n 11 Elton John - Little Jeannie\n 12 Elton John - I Feel Like A Bullet (In The Gun Of Robert Ford)\n 13 Elton John - Can You Feel The Love Tonight\n 14 Elton John - I'm Still Standing\n 15 Elton John - Border Song\n 16 Elton John - Electricity\n 17 Elton John - England's Rose (Candle In The Wind For Lady Diana)\n 18 Elton John - The Greatest Discovery\n 19 Elton John - I Need You To Turn To\n 20 Elton John - The King Must Die\n 21 Elton John - Daniel\n 22 Elton John - Tiny Dancer\n 23 Elton John - Your Song\n 24 Elton John - This Train Don't Stop There Anymore\n 25 Elton John - Bridge\n 26 Elton John - Candle In The Wind\n 27 Elton John - Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\n 28 Elton John &amp; Kiki Dee - Don't Go Breaking My Heart\n 29 Elton John - Believe\n 30 Elton John - Blue Eyes\n 31 Elton John - Song For Guy\n\nB012 All By Myself (Celine Dion)\n\n 01 Celine Dion - Map To My Heart\n 02 Celine Dion - My Heart Will Go On\n 03 Celine Dion - If Walls Could Talk\n 04 Celine Dion &amp; Barbra Streisand - Tell Him\n 05 Celine Dion - A New Day Has Come\n 06 Celine Dion - Alone\n 07 Celine Dion &amp; Peabo Bryson - Beauty And The Beast\n 08 Celine Dion - Because You Loved Me\n 09 Celine Dion - If You Asked Me To\n 10 Celine Dion - The Power Of Love\n 11 Celine Dion - No Living Without Loving You\n 12 Celine Dion - Real Emotion\n 13 Celine Dion - Dance With My Father\n 14 Celine Dion - Brahms' Lullaby\n 15 Celine Dion - Goodbye's [The Saddest Word]\n 16 Celine Dion - I'm Alive\n 17 Celine Dion - Fade Away\n 18 Celine Dion - The Power Of The Dream\n 19 Celine Dion - All By Myself\n 20 Celine Dion &amp; R.
