This album, &quot;A Candle For Judith&quot; (named after Clayton's then girlfriend, later wife), was recorded in just two days, and was released in January 1971.  Today it is one of the great rarities of John Peel's Dandelion label.  (The duo only recorded one other album, the following year, under the name Tractor, a change suggested by Peel.  This album is also available here at TPB.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7cf41d672a8f807709c8da209d24a67b8f33f95","amp;dn":"The+Way+We+Live+-+A+Candle+For+Judith+%281971%29+%28John+Peel%29+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7cf41d672a8f807709c8da209d24a67b8f33f95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,207,65,214,114,168,248,7,112,156,141,162,9,210,74,103,184,243,63,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
