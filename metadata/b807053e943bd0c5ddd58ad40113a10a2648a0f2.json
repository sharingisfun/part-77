Sophia\nhas always been the quintessential good girl, living a life filled\nwith disappointment. Everything changes when their lives become\nintertwined through a chance encounter online.\n\nHundreds of miles separate them, but the connection that draws\nthem together is too much to be denied. As the layers of their lives\npeel back, Kayden keeps the dangerous parts of his past hidden to\nprotect the woman who is becoming more important to him than he\nshould allow. What starts as a pursuit of carnal pleasure turns into\na complicated love story. His past is a tangled web filled with addiction,\nan obsessed ex-girlfriend, and problems with the law.\n\nOne mistake he thought he had left behind may end up ruining it all.\n\n\n\nUntangle Me\nby Chelle Bliss\n703 Pages\nLanguage: EN\nFormat: PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b807053e943bd0c5ddd58ad40113a10a2648a0f2","amp;dn":"Untangle+Me+-+Chelle+Bliss.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b807053e943bd0c5ddd58ad40113a10a2648a0f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,7,5,62,148,59,208,197,221,213,138,212,1,19,161,10,38,72,160,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
