But at the vet's, her husband Mark is talked into letting Danke wet nurse a Great Dane pup that's been abandoned by his mother. And Mark wants to keep the Great Dane. But Brutus has this problem: he thinks he's a dachshund and he's too big to be a lapdog. But when Fran ridicules Brutus one too many times, Jim's got a plan to prove to everyone (and Fran) that a great Dane can be far more than just an ugly dachshund.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b98210d2521886c8b235eea44f7b8c13195edefa","amp;dn":"Disney%27s+The+Ugly+Dachshund+1966.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b98210d2521886c8b235eea44f7b8c13195edefa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,130,16,210,82,24,134,200,178,53,238,164,79,123,140,19,25,94,222,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
