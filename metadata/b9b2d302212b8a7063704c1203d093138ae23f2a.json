Soon after, Professional Standards Inspector Joanna Passero arrives in Eastvale and insists on working the case alongside a reluctant Banks, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s convinced a police officer shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be deemed guilty without proper evidence.\n\nBut the more they learn, the more likely it seems that Quinn wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all he was reputed to be, that his murder is linked to another vicious crime in Yorkshire and to a cold case Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the disappearance of a nineteen-year-old English girl, Rachel Hewitt, in Estonia six years earlier. \n\nIntricate, engrossing, and psychologically tense, the twentieth book in the internationally bestselling series by award-winning author Peter Robinson may be the most suspenseful Banks mystery yet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9b2d302212b8a7063704c1203d093138ae23f2a","amp;dn":"Watching+the+Dark","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9b2d302212b8a7063704c1203d093138ae23f2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,178,211,2,33,43,138,112,99,112,76,18,3,208,147,19,138,226,63,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
