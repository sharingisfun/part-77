It pays homage to the French Gilles Lalay Classic which doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exist anymore. Hell's Gate takes place every year in February, always in the International Centre of Il Ciocco, on the Tuscany Appennino in Italy. A natural paradise where you could built up all kind of tracks, included the scary one of HellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gate. The Tough One Extreme Enduro in the United Kingdom is a hardcore enduro challenge that winds up and over rocky hills, boulder fields, and fellow competitors in the infamous Nantmawr Quarry.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9b670e3d5a8e1a58be32d2c4e809b4b5bd0818f","amp;dn":"Enduro.Kings.Hells.Gate.and.Tough.One.2010.SpeedHD.720P.h264.Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9b670e3d5a8e1a58be32d2c4e809b4b5bd0818f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,182,112,227,213,168,225,165,139,227,45,44,78,128,155,75,91,208,129,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
