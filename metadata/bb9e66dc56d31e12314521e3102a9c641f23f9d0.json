With Booker T. drummer Al Jackson producing, the set includes such staples as &quot;You Threw Your Love on Me Too Strong,&quot; &quot;Wrapped up in Love Again,&quot; and a powerful version of Howlin' Wolf's &quot;Killing Floor.&quot; For fans of King's guitar work, the inclusion of the instrumental workouts on &quot;You Don't Love Me&quot; and &quot;Drowning on Dry Land&quot; are a special bonus. Not an essential Albert King album, but one of his good ones. \n\nReview by Cub Koda","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb9e66dc56d31e12314521e3102a9c641f23f9d0","amp;dn":"Albert+King+-+Years+Gone+By","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb9e66dc56d31e12314521e3102a9c641f23f9d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,158,102,220,86,211,30,18,49,69,33,227,16,42,156,100,31,35,249,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
