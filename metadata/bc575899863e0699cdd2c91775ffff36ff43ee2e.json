This copy is not as high quality as Hector's were but is fine for watching. It's one hour and thirty minutes and only 330mb so that will give you an idea. \n\nAlso on days when fqm is on time I will still post their releases since it seems tvteam has so many different uploads going that it takes a long time for their posts to get well seeded, So please help keep the speeds up by everyone downloading from the same source.\n\nHere are the comments I posted on ep 59 release today for anyone not sure what I'm talking about:\n\n*****Just to let everyone know that Hector is facing some major health issues and will no longer be capping BBAU. I'm looking for another source but so far not having much luck, We may be waiting until FQM gets around to it. They are never in a big hurry. Keep checking in and see if I have come across anything and join me in wishing Hector a speedy recovery. :( ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc575899863e0699cdd2c91775ffff36ff43ee2e","amp;dn":"Big.Brother.AU.s10e60.PDTV.x264.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc575899863e0699cdd2c91775ffff36ff43ee2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,87,88,153,134,62,6,153,205,210,201,23,117,255,255,54,255,67,238,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
