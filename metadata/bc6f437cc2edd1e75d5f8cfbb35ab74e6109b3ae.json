It has\nbeen done, but only using a specific host key. They'd need to randomize the\nprocess, work around the localhost block issue, and a number of other things.\nSo far, they've just succeeded in reading HMAC from memory and using it in\ntheir coding. We will likely see online KMS servers and VMs long before a\nwell-done refined solution like the one that started in MTK 2.4 happens.\nFeel free to share online KMS Servers in the comments as they come online.\nMake sure they support Windows 8.1's v6 protocol. To activate using those\nservers you would open admin command prompt and run:\n\nSLMGR /IPK xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx (gVLK KMS Key read win81-pkeys.txt)\nSLMGR /SKMS www.some-server.net:1688 (mind the syntax, 1688 is default port)\nSLMGR /ATO (Activate using your key and SKMS settings)\n\nThey've added KMS v6 protocol support to existing host systems with the new\npatch file KB2885698. It's only a matter of time until people start hosting\nVM servers that will activate everyone.\n\n-ESD patches were too large. Using WIM patches for now.\n\n-I recommend printing out the win81-pkeys.txt for installs. You can access\nthe one I put on the disk using shift-f10 during setup, navigating to the dvd\nor USB Flash drive, and running &quot;type win81-pkeys.txt&quot; Then simply tab between\nthe command prompt and the key entry window.\n\nCredits:\nmurphy78 - Testing, and ISO design\n\nEnjoy Pirates,\nmurphy78-TPB/MDL :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc6f437cc2edd1e75d5f8cfbb35ab74e6109b3ae","amp;dn":"Windows+8.1+AIO+x64+en-US+WIM+Oct2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc6f437cc2edd1e75d5f8cfbb35ab74e6109b3ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,111,67,124,194,237,209,231,93,95,140,251,179,90,183,78,97,9,179,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
