With his characteristic brutal honesty, Mooney passionately and hysterically charges into the electrified currents of racial tension. In this magnificent standup performance at Hollywood's Laugh Factory, Mooney earns a standing ovation with his relentless no-holds-barred observations on black history, stereotypes and prejudices, living in White America, celebrity divas and much, much more!\n\nSpecifications\t\nColor : Yes\nFormat: NTSC\nRelease Date: 6 February 2007\nRunning Time: 86 min\nNumber of Discs: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be652f4300d4c9576b572e747a5e24b8c803a813","amp;dn":"Paul+Mooney+-+Know+Your+History+-+Jesus+Was+Black...So+Was+Cleop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be652f4300d4c9576b572e747a5e24b8c803a813","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,101,47,67,0,212,201,87,107,87,46,116,122,94,36,184,200,3,168,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
