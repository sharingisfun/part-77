He stops treating patients in order to write and teach Psychotherapy, until many years later a student gets him fascinated by the case of Thomas 'Tommy' Caffey. He was about to be released at his 18th birthday from the closed 'boys school' he was placed into after his father, Joseph, was put into jail for beating his adulterous mother to death. Michael feels that Tommy\ncarries a big chip on his shoulder, ignores that Shelly fell for him at first sight, but is mesmerized by Tomy's resemblance (purposefully enhanced) to Kyle. There is also a revealing meeting with Tommy's dad in jail. Tom McLoughlin directs the downbeat psychological thriller The Unsaid, released straight-to-video in the U.S. Andy Garcia stars as Kansas psychologist Dr. Michael Hunter who quits his practice following the suicide of his teenage son Kyle (Trevor Blumas). Disturbed by the death, separated from his wife, and lacking the Shelley (Linda Cardellini), Michael is soon approached by social worker Barbara (Teri Polo). She needs him to evaluate her client, Thomas Caffey (Vincent Kartheiser), a traumatised teenage boy who is due for release from a juvenile center. Feeling somewhat compelled to offer his services, Michael discovers the boy's horrible past involving his father, Joseph (Sam Bottoms), who is in prison for murder.\n\n\nGeneral\n------------\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 901 MiB\nDuration : 1h 44mn\nOverall bit rate : 1201 Kbps\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.3\nWriting library : VirtualDub build 32842\n\n\nVideo\n------------\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : 1\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Custom\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 44mn\nBit rate : 1063 Kbps\nWidth : 640 pixels\nHeight : 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.739\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.181\nStream size : 797 MiB (89%)\nWriting library : XviD 64\n\n\nAudio\n------------\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : 2000\nDuration : 1h 44mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 96.0 MiB (11%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 512 ms\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be7d918b50b1216ffa1fd64417e15817000922a2","amp;dn":"The+Unsaid+2001+DVDRip+XviD+AC3+titler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be7d918b50b1216ffa1fd64417e15817000922a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,125,145,139,80,177,33,111,250,31,214,68,23,225,88,23,0,9,34,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
