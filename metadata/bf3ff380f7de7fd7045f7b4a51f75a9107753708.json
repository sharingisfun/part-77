Place both files onto SD card directly, not inside of any folder.\n\n\n2. Reboot into recovery. I suggest using the RA-dream recovery you can download it here http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=566669\n\n3. Wipe your phone &quot;factory data reset&quot; (this step isnt really necessary since your phone is wiped after flashing the SPL but I always like to wipe before flashing anything)\n\n+++++++DO NOT SKIP THIS NEXT STEP OR YOU WILL BRICK YOUR PHONE+++++++++\n \nYou must have the latest radio &quot;2_22_19_26I&quot; or &quot;2_22_23_02&quot; to flash this SPL if you already have the latest radio you should not have to flash it again but it will not hurt if you do flash it again. When in doubt flash it anyway. \n\n4. Flash the Radio &quot;ota-radio-2_22_19_26I.zip&quot; or &quot;G1-radio-2_22_23_02.zip&quot; it will install and then it will ask you to reboot to finish the installation, so reboot, it will then finish installing and then reboot back into recovery.\n\n5. Flash the SPL &quot;spl-signed.zip&quot; it will install and then ask you to reboot to finish the installation, so reboot, it will then finish installing and reboot into recovery so you can flash your ROM\n\nA simple way to make sure that the SPL flashed correctly is when you reboot to the boot loader screen by holding the camera button you will see HBOOT-1.33.2005.\n\n\n\n******** For other android stuff, click on my name ********\n\n :D   :D    :D    :D    :D    :D    :D    :D    :D    :D    :D    :D    :D    :D    ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf3ff380f7de7fd7045f7b4a51f75a9107753708","amp;dn":"sapphire+port+dream","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf3ff380f7de7fd7045f7b4a51f75a9107753708","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,63,243,128,247,222,127,215,4,95,123,74,81,247,90,145,7,117,55,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
