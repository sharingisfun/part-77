Not only it protects you from unwanted ads, it protects from phishing and dangerous websites too. While working siltently in the background, it automatically removes advertisements from the web pages you visit, thereby saving your traffic and reducing the page loading time. The program supports both 32x and 64x Windows versions, and it works with all popular browsers.\n\nNew release brings a completely reworked Adguard Assistant module and an integration with Web Of Trust service. We also added a new feature so you could turn off Adguard's UI, while it keeps filtering using the minimum resources.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf78e116690f7c121ca180cd332e22aa5ddbeb78","amp;dn":"Adguard+ver.5.7.966.4992+%5BMulti%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf78e116690f7c121ca180cd332e22aa5ddbeb78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,120,225,22,105,15,124,18,28,161,128,205,51,46,34,170,93,219,235,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
