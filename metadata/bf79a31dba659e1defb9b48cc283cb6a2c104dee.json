Today it is one of the great rarities of John Peel's Dandelion label.\n\nFor their second album, John Peel persuaded them to change their name, and suggested Tractor.  The first release under the new name was a 7&quot; single containing three tracks (one of which is included here as a bonus - track 10).\n\nThe second album (which was the duo's first and only album under the new Tractor name), was released in 1972, also on John Peel's Dandelion label.  Original vinyl copies of this album also fetch high prices today.\n\nThis album here is ripped at 320kbps from a CD reissue, and includes cover scans and bonus tracks.  (NB, there are many misspellings and inconsistencies on the CD reissue cover and booklet, but the MP3 filenames are all correct.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf79a31dba659e1defb9b48cc283cb6a2c104dee","amp;dn":"Tractor+-+Tractor+%281972%29+%28John+Peel%2CDandelion%2Crock%2Cblues%29+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf79a31dba659e1defb9b48cc283cb6a2c104dee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,121,163,29,186,101,158,29,239,185,180,140,194,131,203,106,44,16,77,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
