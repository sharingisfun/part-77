The ship was seized by armed members of the Russian Coast Guard last week after Greenpeace activists tried to board an offshore oil platform as a protest against drilling for fossil fuels in the fragile environment of the Arctic, where global warming has reduced the sea ice cover 40 percent since 1980.\n\nOn this weekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s broadcast Bill Moyers talked with the executive director of Greenpeace International, Kumi Naidoo, about the fate of the Arctic Sunrise and the charges of piracy brought against the crew of 30. Naidoo tells Bill, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s injustice in the world, those of us that have the ability to witness it and to record it, document it and tell the world what is happening have a moral responsibility to do that. Then, of course, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left up to those that are receiving that knowledge to make the moral choice about whether they want to stand up against the injustice or observe it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn an essay following the conversation, Moyers links NaidooÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s courage in speaking truth to power with an account of the recent visit by Pope Francis to Sardinia, the Mediterranean island known for its beautifully beaches and palatial homes owned by the richest of the rich. Sardinia is now blighted by widespread joblessness Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 51 percent of its young people are out of work Ã¢â‚¬â€ and as the pope heard the stories of desperation and deprivation, he threw away his prepared speech and decried a global economic system Ã¢â‚¬Å“that does us so much harm.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The story leads Bill to conclude that unless we Ã¢â‚¬Å“dethrone our present system of financial capitalism that rewards those at the topÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ while everyone else is struggling, Ã¢â‚¬Å“it will consume usÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and democracy will be finished","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf81001e297100ab606eeac4cf8bf4398a012eeb","amp;dn":"Saving+the+Earth+from+Ourselves-PBS+Moyers+%26amp%3B+Company-092713-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf81001e297100ab606eeac4cf8bf4398a012eeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,129,0,30,41,113,0,171,96,110,234,196,207,139,244,57,138,1,46,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
