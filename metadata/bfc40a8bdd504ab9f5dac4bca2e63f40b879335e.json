The team's buttoned-up business manager, Lonni, calls the guys out for looking like slobs so they reluctantly agree to take her advice and upgrade to a more professional image. Later, a critical test for the crew's gun-themed Bubba-Q backfires when Fobo gets his bell rung by a supercharged potato cannon.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 02-Sep-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfc40a8bdd504ab9f5dac4bca2e63f40b879335e","amp;dn":"Bubba-Q.S01E03.HDTV.x264-OMiCRON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfc40a8bdd504ab9f5dac4bca2e63f40b879335e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,196,10,139,221,80,74,185,245,218,196,188,162,230,63,64,184,121,51,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
