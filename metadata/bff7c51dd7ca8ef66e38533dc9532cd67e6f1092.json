They live on the paradise Indonesian island of Sulawesi with the rest of their gang of crested black macaques. These very special primates are found nowhere else in the world. Twenty-five years ago, wildlife cameraman Colin Stafford-Johnson visited Sulawesi for the first time and now he's returned. Fascinated by the monkeys, Colin hopes to reveal their sometimes violent, often playful and, just like our own, highly political world. What he discovers leads him on a much bigger journey than he was ever expecting.\n\n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate:  1500 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 404\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.775 (~16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) \nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s  48000 Hz)\nAudio Streams: stereo (2/0)\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: average 690 MB\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by Harry65\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b039w9p0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b039w9p0&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bff7c51dd7ca8ef66e38533dc9532cd67e6f1092","amp;dn":"BBC.Natural.World.2013.Meet.The.Monkeys.PDTV.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bff7c51dd7ca8ef66e38533dc9532cd67e6f1092","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,247,197,29,215,202,142,246,110,56,83,61,201,83,44,214,126,111,16,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
