Hes late and a power outage at the airport rental company mixes up his booking. Driving now. A phone beeps. Not his phone. A phone inside the rental cars glove compartment. Someone probably left it by mistake. Stuck in traffic now, Michael, scratching around under the car seat, he feels something. Slowly pulling it out -- a gun. Sinister-looking. The kind of gun you kill people with. The phone rings. You were meant to acknowledge receipt of the message. Michael trying to mumble out some explanation that its not his phone, the rental mix-up. Click. The phone goes dead. Michael cant afford any trouble, but has no idea what to do with a gun in the vehicle. This is not good.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c019caa5a5f0c06e01b496f2ea393e9b07edc6c4","amp;dn":"Vehicle+19+2013.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c019caa5a5f0c06e01b496f2ea393e9b07edc6c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,25,202,165,165,240,192,110,1,180,150,242,234,57,62,155,7,237,198,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
