But in Autumn 2002, one semester short of graduating and newly marriedÃ¢â‚¬â€in fact, on his honeymoonÃ¢â‚¬â€he was called to active duty and sent to the front lines in Iraq.\nCrawford and his unit spent months upon months patrolling the streets of Baghdad, occupying a hostile city. During the breaks between patrols, Crawford began recording what he and his fellow soldiers witnessed and experienced. Those stories became The Last True Story I'll Ever TellÃ¢â‚¬â€a haunting and powerful, compellingly honest book that imparts the on-the-ground reality of waging the war in Iraq, and marks as the introduction of a mighty literary voice forged in the most intense of circumstances.\n\nHaving joined the National Guard for the tuition benefits, Crawford, like many of his contemporaries, never expected to do any heavy lifting. Early on, he admits his is &quot;the story of a group of college students... who wanted nothing to do with someone else's war.&quot; But when his Florida National Guard unit was activated, he was shipped to Kuwait shortly before the invasion of Iraq. Armed with shoddy equipment, led by incompetent officers and finding release in the occasional indulgence in pharmaceuticals, Crawford cared little for the mission and less for the Iraqis. &quot;Mostly we were guarding gas stations and running patrols,&quot; he explains. As for Iraqi civilians, &quot;I didn't give a shit what happened to any of them,&quot; he confesses after inadvertently saving an Iraqi boy from a mob beating. Crawford's disdain grows with each extension of his tour, and he leaves Iraq broke, rudderless and embittered. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1f434ebff1d2914e0136ed4f636b538d9afd004","amp;dn":"John+Crawford+-+The+Last+True+Story+I%27ll+Ever+Tell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1f434ebff1d2914e0136ed4f636b538d9afd004","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,244,52,235,255,29,41,20,224,19,110,212,246,54,181,56,217,175,208,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
