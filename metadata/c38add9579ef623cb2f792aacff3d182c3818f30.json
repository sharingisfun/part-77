The band refers to its own style as &quot;Electronic poetry&quot;.[1] From the middle of the 1990s, the band's style changed to a more pop-oriented sound with influences from rock and trip hop.\n\nHistory:\n\nChandeen was founded in 1990 by Harald LÃƒÂ¶wy and Oliver Henkel, who had been working on musical experiments together from the winter of 1989. The name comes from a pet iguana owned by a friend of LÃƒÂ¶wy. In 1991 Aline Akbari joined, and additional singer Antje Schulz joined in 1992.\n\nAfter two cassette releases, they came to the attention of Hyperium Records head Oliver RÃƒÂ¶sch, who signed them. Aline Akbari left the group shortly before the signing and was replaced by Catrin Mallon. Under this lineup they recorded their first two full-lengths, Shaded by the Leaves and Jutland.\n\nIn the process of the studio work for Jutland, internal differences arose between the members, and Catrin Mallon and Oliver Henkel left the group in 1994. The pair went on to collaborate on the project Edera, which produced only one album (1996's Ambiguous) before dissolving.\n\nNew singer Stephanie HÃƒÂ¤rich joined for the 1995 EP Light Within Time, taking Mallon's place. She had previously worked with Harald LÃƒÂ¶wy on the project Incept Date, singing background vocals on their Archipelago album in 1994.\nAfter several releases on Hyperium, the group separated from that label and began releasing on Synthetic Symphony, a sublabel of SPV GmbH. Their 1998 single &quot;Skywalking&quot; was broadcast on MTV Europe and VIVA, and the band made appearances on NBC Giga, but the exposure did not bring them widespread success.\n\nHarald LÃƒÂ¶wy created his own independent label, Kalinkaland, in 2001, which became the primary vehicle for the release of Chandeen's music. Several further releases followed before the group broke up. In 2007 LÃƒÂ¶wy reactivated the project, releasing a new album, Teenage Poetry, in 2008. Julia Beyer joined for this release.\n\nMembers:\n\nCurrent\n\nJulia Beyer - vocals, songwriting\nHarald LÃƒÂ¶wy - music, production, songwriting\n\nFormer\n\nMike Brown - music, production, songwriting (Ã¢â‚¬Â 2012)\nAline Akbari - vocals, songwriting (1991Ã¢â‚¬â€œ93)\nCatrin Mallon - vocals, songwriting (1993Ã¢â‚¬â€œ94)\nStephanie HÃƒÂ¤rich - vocals, songwriting (1995Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2002)\nOliver Henkel - music (1990Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2004)\nAntje Schulz - vocals, songwriting (1992Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2004)\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums &amp; EPs\n\n1994 - Shaded by the Leaves (CD, Hyperium Records)\n1995 - Jutland (CD, Hyperium Records)\n1995 - Light Within Time (EP + CD-ROM Video, Hyperium Records)\n1996 - The Waking Dream (CD, Hyperium Records)\n1998 - Spacerider - Love At First Sight (CD, Synthetic Symphony)\n2002 - Bikes and Pyramids (CD, Kalinkaland Records)\n2003 - Echoes (CD, Kalinkaland Records)\n2008 - Teenage Poetry (CD, Kalinkaland Records)\n2011 - Blood Red Skies (CD, Kalinkaland Records)\n\nCollections\n\n1998 - A Taste Like Ginger (CD, Cleopatra Records)\n2004 - Pandora's Box (CD, Kalinkaland Records)\n\nVideos\n\n1998 - Skywalking (Videoclip)\n\nSingles &amp; Maxis\n\n1994 - Red Letter Days /:Lumis: (MCD, Hyperium Records)\n1995 - Strawberry Passion (MCD, Hyperium Records)\n1996 - Papillon (It's Easy to Fly) (MCD, Hyperium Records)\n1998 - Spacerider (MCD, Synthetic Symphony)\n1999 - Skywalking (MCD, Synthetic Symphony)\n2002 - My World Depends on You (MCD, Out Now Records)\n\nDemos\n\n1992 - The Twilight Crossing - Part I (K7)\n1993 - The Twilight Crossing - Part II (K7)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c38add9579ef623cb2f792aacff3d182c3818f30","amp;dn":"Chandeen+-+Jutland+%281995%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c38add9579ef623cb2f792aacff3d182c3818f30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,138,221,149,121,239,98,60,178,247,146,170,207,243,209,130,195,129,143,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
