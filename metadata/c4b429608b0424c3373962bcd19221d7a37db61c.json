She signed with Capitol Nashville in 1990, and a sampling of tracks from that period are collected as well. The quality is high throughout this very listenable anthology, and many of the non-hits and album tracks are nearly the equal of the better-known hits. Given the quantity of material, there is inevitably a bum track here and there (most notably the bizarre futuristic fantasy of &quot;We Must Believe in Magic&quot;), but in terms of sheer length, this generous import compilation far surpasses anything available domestically. Gayle's music during this era hovers somewhere between the pop-country of, say, Glen Campbell, and the smooth easy listening of the Carpenters, but an occasional strain of pure(r) country sometimes emerges, along with a faint echo of Gayle's hard country sibling, Loretta Lynn..
