Her son Scott is mortified. He still can't believe that his father - a world-class athlete - actually drowned. When Maureen and Oliver announce wedding-plans, Scott's world begins to fall apart. Oliver's attractive daughter Kelly shares Scott's distrust of the impending marriage - and proposes a theory of her own: is it possible that Maureen and Oliver have known each other longer than just a few weeks; and if so, could they have possibly killed Scott's father? The two start to investigate - and soon fall in love. But while they are united by a horrible suspicion, the investigation soon reveals some secrets that keep them apart","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c582ea036fe6890b1b999844ea960d48398349a3","amp;dn":"Fascination+%282004%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c582ea036fe6890b1b999844ea960d48398349a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,130,234,3,111,230,137,11,27,153,152,68,234,150,13,72,57,131,73,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
