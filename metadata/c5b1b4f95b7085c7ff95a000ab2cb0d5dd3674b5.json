Despite losing thirty pounds over the summer, he still gets called Ã¢â‚¬Å“ChunksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Grisner. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worse, he has to share a locker with the biggest Lord of the Rings freak his school has ever seen. He also canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t figure out whether Charlotte VanderKleaton, the beautiful strawberry lip-glossed new girl, likes him the way he likes her. Oh, and then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his mom. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disappearedÃ¢â‚¬â€againÃ¢â‚¬â€and his dad wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t talk about it.\n\nSomewhere between the madness, Charlie can at least find comfort in his one and only talent that just might get him out of this life-sucking place. But will he be able to hold his head above water in the meantime?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5b1b4f95b7085c7ff95a000ab2cb0d5dd3674b5","amp;dn":"The+Downside+of+Being+Charlie+-+Jenny+Torres+Sanchez","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5b1b4f95b7085c7ff95a000ab2cb0d5dd3674b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,177,180,249,91,112,133,199,255,149,160,0,171,44,176,213,221,54,116,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
