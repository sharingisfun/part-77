Today, modern civilization is wholly dependent on the production and distribution of power. Without it, our way of life would be extinguished.\n\nIn Lights On!, Mark Denny reveals the mysterious world of power generation. He takes us on a fun tour, examining the nature of energy, tracing the history of power generation, explaining the processes from production through transmission to use, and addressing questions that are currently in the headlines, such as:Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Is natural gas the best alternative energy source in the near term? Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Could solar power be the answer to all our problems? Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Why is nuclear power such a hard sell, and are the concerns valid?\n\nDevoting individual chapters to each of the forms of power in use todayÃ¢â‚¬â€electrical, coal, oil and natural gas, hydro, nuclear, and solarÃ¢â‚¬â€Denny explains the pros and cons of each, their availability worldwide, and which are in dwindling supply. Making clear that his approach is that of &quot;a scientist and engineer, not a politician or businessman,&quot; Denny addresses environmental concerns by providing information to help readers understand the science and engineering of power generation so they can discuss contemporary energy issues from an informed perspective. For those who wish to delve deeper into the science, a technical appendix provides estimations for a variety of power generators.\n\nAnyone who is interested in how energy works and how it is transformed to power our lives will get a charge out of Lights On!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c76ca89fc6c5510d3a3a093373941eec27b7f577","amp;dn":"Lights+On%21+-Denny-+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+Epub_%28K-Slender%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c76ca89fc6c5510d3a3a093373941eec27b7f577","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,108,168,159,198,197,81,13,58,58,9,51,115,148,30,236,39,183,245,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
