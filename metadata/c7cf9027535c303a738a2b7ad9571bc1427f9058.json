It all leads up to the WPT Championship finale where the Ã¢â‚¬Å“survivorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ walks away with more than $1 million. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a fraction of the money up for grabs over the course of the series. In March 2005 the WPT hit a $100 Million Milestone in money awarded in tournaments to participants that ranged from seasoned pros to college students. The WPT widened the television audience for poker by injecting cutting-edge television production values into the dramatic world of high-stakes, upscale, tournament poker.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7cf9027535c303a738a2b7ad9571bc1427f9058","amp;dn":"World.Poker.Tour.1x06.World.Poker.Finals.DVDRip.XviD-TNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7cf9027535c303a738a2b7ad9571bc1427f9058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,207,144,39,83,92,48,58,115,138,43,122,217,87,27,193,66,127,144,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
