This is FBRBITS.\n\nOur first public release was &quot;52 Complete No-Intro ROM sets FBRBITS&quot;.\nThat huge release had some roms from old consoles etc.\n\nNow we are back with some emulators to play those roms with :)\n\nThis is Emulators.Unlimited-FBRBITS\n\nSome nfo about the source:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEMULATORS UNLIMITED\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEmu On CD - October, 21st, 2002\n\t\t\t       \n1 - INTRODUCTION\n    ------------\n\nWelcome to EMULATORS UNLIMITED. The development of this package is still in very early \nstages, nevertheless, you can find most of the emulators ever published for the PC in\nhere already. Also the bioses you'll need to run emulators on your PC.\n\nEverything is splitted into folders, so it is easy for you to find out what you'll need.\n\n2 - REQUIREMENTS\n    ------------\n\nTo run the emulators inside this CD in your computer you'll need:\n\n\ta) Knowledge on how to run emulators in a computer. Most emulators are tricky to\n           to run, and they need to be unzipped and set up before work.\n\n\tb) Games roms - no games are provided in this CD. You'll either will have to find \n           the ROMs you need, or buy one of the EMU ON CD ROMs CDs.\n\n\tc) Read the documentation - 99% of the emulators are provided with accurate docs\n           inside their ZIPs teaching how to set up them. Read it carefully and you will\n           have no problems.\n\n        d) Winzip - You'll need Winzip to unpack the emulators onto your Hard-drive.\n\n\n3 - SET-UP HINTS\n    ------------\n\n\t1) Search the folder for the system which you want to emulate. First search for\n           the system type (Arcade, Computer, Console, Hand-held or even Multi-emulators).\n\n\t2) Go to the folder and find the emulator you want.\n\n           i.e.: CONSOLES -&gt; ATARI 2600 -&gt; z26v157x.zip\n\n\t3) Unzip the file in your HD in a separate folder.\n\n        4) Follow the instructions on the emulator's README.TXT to know how to make it \n           run for you. Probably you'll need the game ROMs in a folder called ROMS or\n           something, plus the BIOS (if the system requires it).\n\n4 - THE BIOS FILES\n    --------------\n\nYou can find BIOS files for most of the emulators in the BIOS folders under:\n\n\tMULTI-EMULATORS -&gt; MESS -&gt; BIOS\n\nJust in case you need them. http://fbrbits.net/\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c929de8bad197ef6b82e7177a9b5acc2fc88bdd7","amp;dn":"Emulators+Unlimited+FBRBITS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c929de8bad197ef6b82e7177a9b5acc2fc88bdd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,41,222,139,173,25,126,246,184,46,113,119,169,181,172,194,252,136,189,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
