Garrow claims to have been a career cover-operative for the CIA.  Recently he has come forward with allegations that the late tea party conservative, Andrew Breitbart, was killed under orders from Obama administration officials.  He also says that novelist Tom Clancy (who he claims to have fed information for years) was also killed in much the same way. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nowtheendbegins.com/blog/?p=15278&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nowtheendbegins.com/blog/?p=15278&lt;/a&gt;\nNOTE: this article has a link to the site, pinkpagodagirls.com, which AVG alerts as containing malicious code.\n\nI was somewhat disturbed to hear in this interview that Alex is still telling as truth the falsehood that &quot;Michael Hastings' body was cremated by authorities without the familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s permission.&quot;\nSee what journalist Russ Baker and Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs have to say about this myth.   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://whowhatwhy.com/2013/08/13/exclusive-hastings-unauthorized-cremation-mega-rumor-false-family-says/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://whowhatwhy.com/2013/08/13/exclusive-hastings-unauthorized-cremation-mega-rumor-false-family-says/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBackground on Jim Garrow.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
