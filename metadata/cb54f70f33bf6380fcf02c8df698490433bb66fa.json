She wears her school uniform along with a bright pink rucksack.\nThe Umihara Kawase games' main distinction is their tranquil fish and bird infested worlds and the rope physics, which defines the gameplay.\nThe name is written as four kanji characters: umi, hara, kawa, se meaning sea, belly, river, back. This is an extraction from a Japanese kitchen idiom &quot;Sea fish are fat in the belly; river fish are fat in the back.&quot;. Shun means &quot;in season&quot;.\nThe protagonist was first seen in the eponymous Super Famicom release of 1994 and later the sequel and re-release of Umihara Kawase Shun (?????? Umihara Kawase Shun) for the PlayStation in 1997 and 2000.\n\n\nIMAGE: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTNaZ8HNNM4j1gA2La31SMghuCdLh77K2BbW_bDNOW9t2NoPLHd5w&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTNaZ8HNNM4j1gA2La31SMghuCdLh77K2BbW_bDNOW9t2NoPLHd5w&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb54f70f33bf6380fcf02c8df698490433bb66fa","amp;dn":"Umihara+Kawase+Shun+2nd+JAP+PSX2PSP-DiPSOMANiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb54f70f33bf6380fcf02c8df698490433bb66fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,84,247,15,51,191,99,128,252,240,44,141,246,152,73,4,51,187,102,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
