It is included in this 33rd bundle today, as well as my 31st bundle from a few days back.  The copy I shared in bundle #31 was a single disc leaked copy.  Encoded at 128kbps I believe.  The copy included in today's bundle is a two disc version, with disc #2 being a remix collection.  And at a higher bit rate.  I wasn't going to bother resharing it, but I felt that maybe some of you might be blessed to have this version in your collections.\n\nWe now have 859 releases this year, 141 titles shy of my goal.\n\nBundle 33 includes the following 23 releases...\n\n * 33 Miles - 2013 - Let It Be Glory\n * Andrew Belle - 2013 - Black Bear\n * B.I.P - 2013 - Sinner 2 Saint\n * For King And Country - 2013 - Hope Is What We Crave - Single\n * Fuzed Worship - 2013 - Forever You Reign - Single\n * Gordon Mote - 2013 - All Things New\n * Hillsong - 2013 - Young And Free - Wake - Single\n * iHOP - 2013 - The Best Of The Prayer Room Live Vol 50\n * Jars of Clay - 2013 - Inland\n * John Tussey - 2013 - Frequencies Of Thought\n * King James - 2013 - Maximus\n * Love And The Outcome - 2013 - Love And The Outcome\n * Magazine Society - 2013 - Magazine Society\n * Maranatha Music - 2013 - Heart Of Worship - Grace\n * Matt Wertz - 2013 - Heatwave\n * Michael Card - 2013 - Sleep Sound In Jesus\n * Pillar - 2013 - Songs From The Hollow\n * Seth Condrey - 2013 - Keeps On Changing\n * Social Club - 2013 - Summer Of George\n * Todd Koeppen - 2013 - The Gospel Of John\n * Until Yesterday - 2013 - Until Yesterday EP\n * Various - 2013 - Electropraise, Vol 3\n * Various - 2013 - Grace Unplugged\n\nIn His Glorious Name,\nTorrentTracts - August 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cce894f2cb5156656f934a6742a1b6221babc341","amp;dn":"2013+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+33%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cce894f2cb5156656f934a6742a1b6221babc341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,232,148,242,203,81,86,101,111,147,74,103,66,161,182,34,27,171,195,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
