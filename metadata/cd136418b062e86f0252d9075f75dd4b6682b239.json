Through interviews, archive and\ndramatic re-construction, they will discover that blood\nline,criminal activity, clothing, religion, nationality,\nchoice of weapon and prison were just as important to gangs\nin Victorian and Edwardian Britain as they are today.\n\nThe brothers famously portrayed the Krays in the eponymous\n1990 film but Gangs of Britain will be their first piece of\nfactual television as a duo. In each programme, they\ninterweave the stories of a modern and a historical gang\nfrom a major UK city. The series kicks off in Glasgow before\nvisiting Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, London and\nSheffield.\n\nGary tackles stories from the past, retelling extraordinary\naccounts of murder, vice, thievery and extortion from the\ncriminal gangs that ran Britain from the 19th to mid-20th\nCenturies. From the long fringe, silk neckerchief, peaked\nhat and wooden clogs of ManchesterÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s teenage Scuttlers to\nthe Teddy Boy Ã¢â‚¬Å“EdwardianÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ look of LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Elephant Boys\ngang. The series visits the infamous landmarks and interviews\nhistorians and experts to uncover and piece together evidence\nand archives that build up a unique and unfamiliar map\nof Gangland Britain.\n\nMartin will immerse himself in more contemporary gangs that\nstill have living members and victims able to recount what\nhappened in recent years. He will meet the police, experts,\nmembers and ex-members of some of the countyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most notorious\ngangs. From the Burger Bar Boys to the Kings of the Old Kent\nRoad, Gangs of Britain will build up a fascinating picture of\nthe dark underbelly of the United Kingdom.\n\nGlasgow\nGlasgow is a city divided. Cut in half by one lethal weapon\nthe blade. There are more scarred faces in Glasgow than\nanywhere else in Britain and in 2002 the World Health\nOrganisation designated Glasgow the murder capital of Europe.\n\n\nLiverpool\nGary and Martin turn the spotlight on Liverpool and its life\nblood, the River Mersey. From the very beginning the docks\ndetermined the fortunes of this city. They have also allowed\nlocal criminals to play a part on the international stage,\nthe most infamous being Curtis Warren, a leading figure in\nthe Liverpool Mafia in the '90s.\n\n\nManchester\nA knife attack leaves a teenage gang member fatally wounded\non an Edwardian Manchester street. Around a century later,\nin another part of the city, a man is shot dead attending\nthe wake of his friend Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the victim of another gang murder.\n\n\nBirmingham\nIn the early part of the 20th century racetracks became a\nbattleground for gangs across the country. A Birmingham gang\ncalled the Brummagems was top dog and built up a criminal\nnetwork extending far beyond their city.\n\n\n\nLondon - East &amp; West\nGary and Martin Kemp turn their attentions to BritainÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s capital.\nLondon has always had criminals. The biggest city\nin Britain is like a magnet to those wanting to make a bob\nor two Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even if that means taking the law into their\nown hands.\n\nSheffield\nIn 2008, an illicit message sent from prison ignites a gang\nfeud in Sheffield and a supposed traitor becomes a marked\nman. The gang is called the S3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ named after the postcode\nof their area.\n\n\nGangs have risen and fallen. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve moved from gambling\ninto clubs and protection, smuggling and prostitution,\nclubs and protection. Today they make millions from\nfull-scale drug importation. But is there a pattern to\ntheir criminality?\n\nOriginal SOURCE: newRock/TV/DDL &lt; Cheers\nVideo: MP4/H264/852*464/25fps\nAudio: AAC/2ch/128Kbps\nSample Included: Yes\nFile Size: 500MB x6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd136418b062e86f0252d9075f75dd4b6682b239","amp;dn":"Gangs+Of+Britain+S1+%5B2013%5DPDTV.480p.H264-BINGO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd136418b062e86f0252d9075f75dd4b6682b239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,19,100,24,176,98,232,111,2,82,217,7,95,117,221,75,102,130,178,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
