This file does NOT contain MS XP update files. \n\nBe aware that for a clean install, the Harddisk driver should be installed first. \n\nAlso included are the HTML from Panasonic's website of the instructions associated with some of the more complicated installs. \n\nThese files were compiled because Panasonic's site sucks. You probably don't need all of these drivers installed. Many of thier sites links are dead, and their java based site is slow and painful.

What do I do?\nIf your Toughbook has an integrated GPS, this may be conflicting with the touchpad or touchscreen driver. You can fix this by running the GPS Registry Patch - SKIPENUM.REG, which is found in the C:UTILGPS folder. This file can also be found by following the link below.\n\nIf you are using a GPS module that is not integrated, you should contact the manufacturer of the GPS module for a similar patch.\n\nIf you are not using a GPS module, or if the above steps do not fix your problem, re-install the touchpad and/or touchscreen drivers. &quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d06e2f44086bf1c700f60ebbfe3aa46136abfc17","amp;dn":"Panasoinc+Toughbook+CF-30+Model+C+D+Win+XP+SP2+clean+install+dri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d06e2f44086bf1c700f60ebbfe3aa46136abfc17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,110,47,68,8,107,241,199,0,246,14,187,254,58,164,97,54,171,252,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
