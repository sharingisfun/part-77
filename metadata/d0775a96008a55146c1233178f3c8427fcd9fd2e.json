A sinister cult called Unity Fields commits mass suicide in a horrific manner - by fire - at the behest of its psychopathic leader, Harris. Only one young woman named Cynthia survives to tell the tale. Now, 13 years later, Cynthia is having grim reminders of the mass-suicide, as people around her begin to die one at a time. Cynthia finds out quickly that the ghost of Harris is back... to claim his 'love child'.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0775a96008a55146c1233178f3c8427fcd9fd2e","amp;dn":"Bad+Dreams+%7B1988%7D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0775a96008a55146c1233178f3c8427fcd9fd2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,119,90,150,0,138,85,20,108,18,51,23,143,60,132,39,252,217,253,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
