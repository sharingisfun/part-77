I.E. if your driver is a Radeon 7970, it will most likely give you an error upon start-up. If it gives you an error when trying to run it,\ngo into the &quot;redist&quot; folder and manually install the following:\n xnafx30_redist\n dotnetfx35setup\n PhysX_9.09.0814_SystemSoftware\n DirectX\n\nDescription: Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have one chance. Find a strong place, and band together. Build our defenses. Gather supplies. Arm ourselves for the fight and save as many souls as we can. Take back our town, our lives, our world from the hungry dark. That wave will break over this town like a tsunami and take the last of us with themÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ unless we fight back.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nFort Zombie is a focused-scope, casual RPG title in which the game world revolves around a single building Ã¢â‚¬â€œ your fort Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the mission specific chunks of the small town that surrounds it. Instead of a major city or a vast countryside, playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s focus their efforts on building up a single structure, finding and training survivors, and venturing out into town looking for supplies.\n\nPlayers take control of a particular building in town, and begin gathering the supplies and survivors needed to build it up by day and help defend it by night.\n\nChoose one of three buildings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the school, the prison, and the policestation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as your Fort Zombie, each one with its own strengths and weaknesses!\nReal time movement and combat keep the tensions level high while trying to achieve objectives before your characters run out of ammunition, food, or luck!\nDozens of zombies, some with special abilities derived from their halfremembered lives before becoming undead!\nPiety, Indiana, a variable 3D town, created using KerberosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mix-andmatchtile system, for maximum replayability. PhysX engine adds to the mayhem!\nDozens of town locations to search (stores, restaurants, gas stations, ruins, homes) and countless items to find and use in building up The Fort or building up your group characters (food, fuel, generators, tools, guns, etc.)\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nMinimum Specifications:\nOS:\tXP and Vista\nProcessor:\tIntel Core2 Duo 6600 or equivalent,\nRAM:\t2 GB\nHard Drive:\t1 GB\nVideo Card:\tDirectX 9.0c SM2 compliant graphics card with 512 MB of RAM\nAdditional Info:\tDirectX compatible soundcard, DirectX 9.0c, mouse &amp; keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0fca6a5d1e600076029f07d418f032b11bc767b","amp;dn":"Fort+Zombie+V1.07+%28Latest%2Ffinal+build%29+Full+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0fca6a5d1e600076029f07d418f032b11bc767b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,252,166,165,209,230,0,7,96,41,240,125,65,143,3,43,17,188,118,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
