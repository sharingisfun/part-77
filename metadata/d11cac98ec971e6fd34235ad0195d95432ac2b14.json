However, JuliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“boys clubÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of bosses dismisses her concerns as trivial and repeatedly rebuffs her efforts. Meanwhile, recently hired detective Ã¢â‚¬Å“Diane HarkinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Drea de Matteo) faces similar resistance from fellow officers in her new precinct when she discovers numerous unsolved stalking cases. But for Diane, the fight to change the system is personal. She herself is on the run, having fled a violent ex-husband who wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rest until he catches up with her and their young son. Crossing paths on an especially harrowing case of a woman terrorized by an obsessive former lover (Mena Suvari), Diane and Julia find common ground and form an unlikely partnership to tackle the case. But the two soon realize that to beat stalkers at their own game, they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t play strictly by the rules, and that bringing these criminals to justice means both Diane and Julia must put their careers -- and lives -- on the line. Henry Simmons (Ã¢â‚¬Å“NYPD BlueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“SharkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) also stars as HarkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s partner Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cliff.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\n\n\nCast: \n\nMena Suvari  ...  Ivy  \n\nDrea de Matteo  ...
