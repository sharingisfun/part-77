Eclipse's house ads describe the series as &quot;the story of King Artuk, Lord of Death, who seeks to conquer ancient Tairngir&quot;. No idea if he succeeded or not, but the artwork is very nice, with something of a John Severin feel to it.\n\nAll two issues are collected here. [Insert thanks to creators and scanners]! [Insert synonyms for 'download' and 'upload', with alliteration if possible]!\n\n\n\nThis torrent's 2-for-1 is Alan Moore's (and Alan Davis's and Garry Leach's and Rick Veitch's and John Totleben's and Neil Gaiman's and Mark Buckingham's) seminal work, 'Miracleman'! An early 80s classic that launched/bolstered a great many careers, you need to read it if you haven't already and, if you have, you need to read it again. As much as I like the Moore issues, I find it's the out-of-the-corner-of-your-eye stories by Gaiman and Buckingham that stick with me.
