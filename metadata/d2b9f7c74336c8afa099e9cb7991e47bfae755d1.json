O]ne day, the bravest and most handsome of all princes rode to the tower to face the horrible beast. The dragon was fierce, but the prince was strong. He was able to strike down the dragon with a single blow - for when you're pure of blood and intention, no evil can stand in your way. That very day, the prince and princess were married. They lived happily ever after and had lots of beautiful children. The End.&quot;\n- Little Princess: &quot;That story is complete HOGWASH.&quot;\n- Queen: &quot;Excuse me?&quot;\n- Little Princess: &quot;First of all, it's full of plotholes. I mean, really. What kind of dragon dies with one blow?&quot;\n- Queen: &quot;[... H]ush, little princess.&quot;\n- Little Princess: &quot;All I know is that when I turn sixteen, you and Dad had better not lock me in some ...&quot;\n\n   [some years later]\n\n- Teenage Princess [locked in tower]: &quot;... tower.&quot;\n- Prince [calling to tower]: &quot;Fair maiden! Be you Adrienne?&quot;\n- Teenage Princess [indicating her dusky complexion]: &quot;Be you a MORON? [...] Does this look FAIR to you? [...] Don't let the dragon hit you on the way out.&quot;\n- Prince [uh-oh]: &quot;D...d...dragon?&quot;\n- Sparky the Dragon [looming into frame behind Prince]: &quot;SNARL&quot;\n\n---\n\nContains:\n\nPRINCELESS - The original series. Four issues compiled into one pseudo-TPB, from original digital releases by Tithe-Empire. Low- to Very-Low-Res, unfortunately.\n\nPRINCELESS VOLUME TWO - The follow-up series. Same origin and compilation, but of far better resolution. :D\n\nGIRLS WHO FIGHT BOYS - Short story from the 2013 FCBD issue. Apparently set at some point after &quot;Volume Two&quot;.\n\nTHE PRINCESS' NEW CLOTHES - Short story from the &quot;Tales of the Family Ashe&quot; anthology issue. Direct continuation of &quot;Volume Two&quot;.\n\nNIGHTLIGHT - Ditto.\n\n---\n\nMisses:\n\nAnother handful of shorts contained in the anthology series &quot;Short Stories For Warrior Women&quot; - two issues' worth so far. I also decided to exclude the third short contained in &quot;Tales of the Family Ashe&quot; for the time being, as that one is a &quot;Part 2&quot; whose &quot;Part 1&quot; is one of these missing ones, if you see what I mean.
