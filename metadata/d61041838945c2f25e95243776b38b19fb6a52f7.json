From Henry VIII to Edward VIII's abdication in 1936, this three-part series re-introduces our past royals not just as powerful potentates, but as human beings, each with their own very personal problems of biology and psychology. In this first episode, Lucy explores the medical histories of the Tudor and Stuart dynasties, beginning with the ascension of Henry VIII and tracing the changing fortunes of these two very different royal families up to the execution of Charles I. Five hundred years ago our monarchs derived their authority from God alone, but despite their semi-divine status, they were subject to exactly the same harsh physical realities as the rest of us.\n\nHISTORY DOCUMENTARY: Fit to Rule: How Royal Illness Changed History\nOn: BBC 2    \nDate: Monday 15th April 2013 (Already shown)\nTime: 21:00 to 22:00 (1 hour long)\nEpisode 2: Bad Blood: Stuarts to Hanoverians\nDr Lucy Worsley explores the medical histories of the later Stuarts, from the exile of James II and the succession of William and Mary to the rise of a new dynasty - the Hanoverians. This was a transformational stage for the monarchy: following William and Mary's 'Glorious Revolution', monarchs were no longer semi-divine, but answerable to their people and to Parliament. But without their cloak of divinity, their human frailties were now under public scrutiny like never before, and if biology failed them, an increasingly powerful Parliament could step in and take control.\n\nHISTORY DOCUMENTARY: Fit to Rule: How Royal Illness Changed History\nOn: BBC 2    \nDate: Monday 22nd April 2013 (Already shown)\nTime: 21:00 to 22:00 (1 hour long)\nEpisode 3: Happy Families: Hanoverians to Windsors\nDr Lucy Worsley explores the medical histories and fraught family dynamics of Queen Victoria and her descendants. Victoria had no problem producing children, but rearing them proved more problematical. She and Bertie - the future Edward VII - whom she thought to be psychologically incapable of the job of king, shared a fractious bond, and the emotional strains the family faced trying to reconcile the competing demands of public duty and a private life also took a toll. Lucy also reveals how Victoria's severe depression following Albert's death almost cost her the crown, and explores the turmoil of Edward VIII's abdication.\n\nFormat for all\nFormat            : AVI at 1 144 Kbps\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 006 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 25.000 fps\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d61041838945c2f25e95243776b38b19fb6a52f7","amp;dn":"How+Royal+Illness+Changed+History++%28BBC+2013+-+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d61041838945c2f25e95243776b38b19fb6a52f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,16,65,131,137,69,194,242,94,149,36,55,118,179,139,25,251,106,82,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
