And inside: The mighty King Neptune has stolen the Krusty Krab and brought it to his legendary palace. Can the combined idiocy of Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and SpongeBob wrest it from Neptune's godly grasp? Find out in 'The Krusty Nabbed!' Next, Sandy is appalled by the horrible inaccuracies rampant in Bikini Bottom's Museum of Land Creatures...but wait until she finds out what they say about squirrels! The fur is flying in 'Landquarium.' Also, Squidward learns the pleasures and pitfalls of earplugs, Gary meets his dream snail, and Plankton paints a portrait of his darling wife! Plus: a fill-in comic and SpongeFunnies by Kochalka!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6248bc54d1dc4854ccb326fc82b7e00adbdea7e","amp;dn":"Spongebob+Comics+21+%28PDF%29+-+June+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6248bc54d1dc4854ccb326fc82b7e00adbdea7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,36,139,197,77,29,196,133,76,203,50,111,200,43,126,0,173,189,234,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
