When he discovers that his attack didn't kill Deborah, he comes to the hospital to finish what he started.\n\n\nThe film became controversial in the UK after it briefly appeared on the DPP 72 list of video nasties.\nThe limp Michael Ironside sports at the end of the movie was real; he broke his ankle on the first day of filming.\nStar Michael Ironside was cast as Colt Hawker partly because he had given such a sinister performance in David Cronenberg's Scanners, which was also from the same producers of Visiting Hours.\nThis was the first of the UK's infamous 'Video Nasty' films to be aired on television. The ITV network aired the film uncut in 1989 and subsequently the network received a fine from the Broadcasting Standards Council.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d649392bb4f064387db9270ca7307fab643d9bfe","amp;dn":"Visiting+Hours+%281982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d649392bb4f064387db9270ca7307fab643d9bfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,73,57,43,180,240,100,56,125,185,39,12,167,48,127,171,100,61,155,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
