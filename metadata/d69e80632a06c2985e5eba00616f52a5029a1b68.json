The failure of the offensive marked a turning point for Yugoslavia during World War II.\n\nThe operation immediately followed Case White which had failed in accomplishing the same objectives: to eliminate the central Partisan formations and capture their commander, Marshal Josip Broz Tito.\n\n\nThe Battle of Sutjeska is a 1973 partisan film directed by Stipe DeliÃ„â€¡, and made in SFR Yugoslavia. It tells the story of the famous Battle of Sutjeska, the greatest engagement of the Yugoslav Partisan War. It is one of the most expensive films made in Yugoslavia. It was selected as the Yugoslav entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 46th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.[1] It was also entered into the 8th Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Special Prize.[2]\n\n\n\nThe Battle of Sutjeska\nDirected by \tStipe DeliÃ„â€¡\nProduced by \tNikola PopoviÃ„â€¡\nWritten by \tBranimir Ã…Â Ã„â€¡epanoviÃ„â€¡\nSergei Bondarchuk\nWolf Mankowitz (uncredited)\nMilijenko Smoje (uncredited)\nOrson Welles (uncredited)\nStarring \tRichard Burton\nIrene Papas\nGÃƒÂ¼nter Meisner\nMusic by \tMikis Theodorakis\nCinematography \tTomislav Pinter\nEditing by \tVojislav Bjenjas\nRoberto Perpignani\nDistributed by \tAmerican International Pictures\nRelease date(s) \t\n\n    1973\n\nRunning time \t128 minutes\nCountry \tYugoslavia\nLanguage \tSerbo-Croatian","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d69e80632a06c2985e5eba00616f52a5029a1b68","amp;dn":"The+Battle+of+Sutjeska+%281973%29+DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d69e80632a06c2985e5eba00616f52a5029a1b68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,158,128,99,42,6,194,152,94,94,186,0,97,111,82,165,2,154,27,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
