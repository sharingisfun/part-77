It starts off with dubstep, then moves on to trap, trance, drum and bass, and ambient. It gives me an opportunity to tie up loose ends, hence the name, but I believe it also stands in its own right as well. Hope you enjoy it! \n\nThis album is also my first release on my own digital-distribution imprint label, Adduct Records, that I founded with my friend Lucas. We're very excited to get it started, and we're currently accepting submissions from any up-and-coming electronic artists of any type at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f59491918096818790969a879186b59298949c99db969a98db&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; We'd love to have you on the team!\ncredits\nreleased 05 August 2013 \nThanks to Ben Slepp for the ochrence logo and thanks to Lucas Wood for helping with cover ideas.
