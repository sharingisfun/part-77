On further investigation Clarke finds more than meets the eye:in the Mapuche and Voroga languages every word has at least two meanings.Witty, very ironic, and with all the usual Airian digressive magic, The Hare offers subtle reflections on love, Victorian-era colonialism, and the many ambiguities of language","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d88da183e0b9c64b71897b03a1a590519793b10d","amp;dn":"The+Hare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d88da183e0b9c64b71897b03a1a590519793b10d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,141,161,131,224,185,198,75,113,137,123,3,161,165,144,81,151,147,177,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
