In addition to creating a unique musical sound, he has won praise for his power as a lyricist. His precisely worded narratives, with their sense of humour about daily life, stand as metaphors for the social and economic ills that bedevil his country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d92467e218b343ca3fb7a1643b453f9a8af1ce7a","amp;dn":"Oliver+Mutukudzi_TUKU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d92467e218b343ca3fb7a1643b453f9a8af1ce7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,36,103,226,24,179,67,202,63,183,161,100,59,69,63,154,138,241,206,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
