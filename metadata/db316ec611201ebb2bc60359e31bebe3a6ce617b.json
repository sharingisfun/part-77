Liege-Killer is part of a trilogy, which includes Ash Ock and The Paratwa. In Liege-Killer, human experimentation on human embryos in the near future produced a new species: the Paratwa, a single consciousness occupying telepathically linked bodies. The Paratwa are highly skilled warriors but look like normal people and are not necessarily identical twins, and can even be a pair of male and female. The books follow the activities of humans and Paratwa as these old enemies are reunited more than a century after the earth's apocalypse during which humans had thought the Paratwa race had become extinct. \n\ncbr format","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db316ec611201ebb2bc60359e31bebe3a6ce617b","amp;dn":"Binary+GN+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db316ec611201ebb2bc60359e31bebe3a6ce617b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,49,110,198,17,32,30,187,43,198,3,89,227,27,235,227,166,206,97,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
