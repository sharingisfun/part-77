Pearl in the Sand tells Rahab's untold story. Rahab lives in a wall; her house is built into the defensive walls of the City of Jericho. Other walls surround her as well--walls of fear, rejection, and unworthiness. A woman with a wrecked past; a man of success, of faith...of pride. A marriage only God would conceive! Through the heartaches of a stormy relationship, Rahab and Salmone learn the true source of one another's worth and find healing in God.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbbc7f2b5de309b2f785ace88c342b677ffa58a2","amp;dn":"Pearl+In+The+Sand+-+Tessa+Afshar.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbbc7f2b5de309b2f785ace88c342b677ffa58a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,188,127,43,93,227,9,178,247,133,172,232,140,52,43,103,127,250,88,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
