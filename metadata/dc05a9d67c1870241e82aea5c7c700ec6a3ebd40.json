Each issue was edited by a different person who was well-known in the mini-comics world. Creators include Larry Marder, Erik Larson and... and... well, a bunch of people you've likely never heard of. Still, some interesting stuff and a nice window into the times.\n\nAll four issues are contained within. Thank you scanners! Thank you creators that I don't really recognize!
