The style and tone are vintage Burroughs; the themes of addiction, mind control, and homosexuality central to the novels are explored here more succinctly. The most original material consists of comments on writing and writers: perceptive remarks on Hemingway and Fitzgerald, an interesting comparison of Proust and Beckett, and an acknowledgment of Conrad's influence on a portion of Naked Lunch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc40db4d33239028eee90f98dc3e8f0155e7068e","amp;dn":"The+Adding+Machine%3A+Selected+Essays","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc40db4d33239028eee90f98dc3e8f0155e7068e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,64,219,77,51,35,144,40,238,233,15,152,220,62,143,1,85,231,6,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
