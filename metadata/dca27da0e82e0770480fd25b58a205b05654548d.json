Laure once dreamed with her best friend Madeleine of using her needlework stills to become a seamstress on the Rue Saint-HonorÃƒÂ© and to one day marry a gentleman. The King, however, needs French women in his new colony and he finds a fresh supply in the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest orphanage. Laure and Madeleine know little of the place called New France, except for stories of ferocious winters and men who eat the hearts of French priests. To be banished to Canada is a punishment worse than death.\n\nBride of New France explores the challenges of coming into womanhood in a brutal time and place. From the moment she arrives in Ville-Marie (Montreal), Laure is expected to marry and produce children with a French soldier who can himself barely survive the harsh conditions of his forest cabin. But Laure finds, through her clandestine relationship with Deskaheh, an allied Iroquois, a sense of the possibilities in this New World. \nWhat happens to a woman who attempts to make her own life choices in such authoritative times?\n\nBride of New France is a beautiful debut novel that explores a fascinating chapter in Canadian history.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dca27da0e82e0770480fd25b58a205b05654548d","amp;dn":"Bride+of+New+France+by+Suzanne+Desrochers+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dca27da0e82e0770480fd25b58a205b05654548d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,162,125,160,232,46,7,112,72,15,210,91,88,162,5,176,86,84,84,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
