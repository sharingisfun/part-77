The solitude of her woodsy family estate, the peace of her tranquil town, and the unspoken somberness of her home life are suddenly upended by not only this mysterious accident, but by the sudden arrival of her Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), whom she never knew existed. When Charlie moves in with her and her emotionally unstable mother Evie (Nicole Kidman), India thinks the void left by her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death is finally being filled by his closest bloodline. Soon after his arrival, India comes to suspect that this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives. Yet instead of feeling outrage or horror, this friendless young woman becomes increasingly infatuated with him.\n\nGenre: Drama | Mystery | Thriller\nIMDB Rating: 7.5/10 from 9,174 users Metascore: 58/100\nDirected by: Chan-wook Park\nStarring: Mia Wasikowska, Nicole Kidman, Matthew Goode\n\nRelease Name: Stoker.2013.HDRip.XviD-AQOS\nSize: 720 MiB\nVideo: AVi | 640 x 272 | 1 013 Kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 2.0 | 128 kbps\nRuntime: 1h 39mn\nSubtitles: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de19ebd6d4c34749440efd1628a8bb0b5bfcd86c","amp;dn":"Stoker+2013+HDRip+XviD-AQOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de19ebd6d4c34749440efd1628a8bb0b5bfcd86c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,25,235,214,212,195,71,73,68,14,253,22,40,168,187,11,91,252,216,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
