Dire circumstances can create strange bedfellows, and Dominique reluctantly agrees to become the bachelor party gift for Lord Derek Montford.\n\nA not-so-reformed rake, the Earl of Haversham is out celebrating his impending marriage when his friends insist he be given one last fling. Not overly impressed with their choice in females, Derek is nevertheless unable to resist having her.\n\nDerek's tempting present begins turning up at the most inopportune times and getting under his skin, when all he really wants is for his vexing attraction toward Dominique to just disappear.\n\nPrint Length: 271 pages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de1af8694bb9b1d933f87a3b7907aee6dc43b41f","amp;dn":"The+Tryst+-+Kim+Allison+-+Erotic+Novel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de1af8694bb9b1d933f87a3b7907aee6dc43b41f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,26,248,105,75,185,177,217,51,248,122,59,121,7,174,230,220,67,180,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
