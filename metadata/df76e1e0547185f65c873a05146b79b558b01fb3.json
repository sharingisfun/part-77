Though it certainly has some down home hard drinkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sass, FuturebirdsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sound is also painstakingly crafted and considerably dense. Pedal steel laps up against banjo, piano, mandolin and psychedelic guitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the mile wide reverb blends everything into a weighty alt-country sound that evokes a meeting of early My Morning Jacket and Uncle Tupelo. Though the boys seem to aspire a Waylon Jennings Ã¢â‚¬Å“outlaw countryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ideal, their experimental leanings actually make for a more unique (and interesting) polyblend. Their debut record, HamptonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lullaby, is full of such nuance and bespeaks a promising start for the young band.\n\nThe recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Johnny Utah,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is also its best Ã¢â‚¬â€œ setting the recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eclectic tone as well as a high bar. The tune starts out with some Eastern sounding strings before launching into a bittersweet melody that, if not for the delicate touch of pedal steel, would fit comfortably under the indie rock genre. Labels donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sit easily on the band though as they navigate the front end of the record, seamlessly integrating gothic country, rock, and experimental folk. Haunting vocal harmonies give Ã¢â‚¬Å“There is no Place for this to GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a melancholy longing, while an undercurrent of honkytonk piano gets the toe tapping. Guitar distortion cuts a swath through the center of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sam JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ banjo plucking and effects pedals, making for one of the most unique tracks on the album. And while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Battle For RomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Drive-By-Truckers style of hard kicking country is less ambiguous, it still makes for a great tune.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df76e1e0547185f65c873a05146b79b558b01fb3","amp;dn":"Futurebirds+-+Hampton%27s+Lullaby+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df76e1e0547185f65c873a05146b79b558b01fb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,118,225,224,84,113,133,246,92,135,58,5,20,107,121,181,88,176,31,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
