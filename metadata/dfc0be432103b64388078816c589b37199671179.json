Even before physicists worked that one out, military engineers had been tinkering with ballistic devices for centuries. The trebuchet of the Middle Ages has given way to rocket power, and the science of ballistics has evolved to match the technology. Mark Denny s survey covers this dynamic subject from prehistory to the weapons of tomorrow. Taking the bang-whiz-thud approach, Denny first talks about internal ballisticsÃ¢â‚¬â€Bang!-from before gunpowder to the development of modern firearms. External ballistics-Whiz!-are next, with discussions about short- and long-range trajectories. Denny s lesson ends with a Thud!Ã¢â‚¬â€an explanation of terminal ballistics. Throughout, Denny conveys applicable physics principles in a way that will appeal to technology buffs and ballistics enthusiasts alike. His fun and factual explanations are free of complicated equations; notes cover the key aspects of ballistics physics for the more technically inclined. Denny has perfected this engaging balance of science and story. For study or hobby, Their Arrows Will Darken the Sun is an entertaining guide to the world of ballistics.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfc0be432103b64388078816c589b37199671179","amp;dn":"Their+Arrows+Will+Darken+the+Sun%3A+The+Evolution+and+Science+of+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfc0be432103b64388078816c589b37199671179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,192,190,67,33,3,182,67,136,7,136,22,197,137,179,113,153,103,17,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
