Communication Breakdown\n\n\n\nA really interesting New York show, it's the first time in 1975 that they drop &quot;How Many More Times&quot; from the set and replace it with &quot;Dazed and confused&quot;. The sound quality is good, however it was taped by &quot;Noisy Arty&quot; who likes to comment on the band and joke around with his friends during the songs. Some of it is annoying but all in all it's pretty funny.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and please share freely,\n\n\nArtwork included.\n\n\nA.M.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e04171416388e69ff1ea2a865da4ff87218125d7","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+1975-02-03+Madison+Square+Garden%2C+NY+AUD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e04171416388e69ff1ea2a865da4ff87218125d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,65,113,65,99,136,230,159,241,234,42,134,93,164,255,135,33,129,37,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
