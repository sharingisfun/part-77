But her arranged marriage to Louis VII, King of France, is made disastrous by Louis's weakness of will and fanatical devotion to the Church. Eleanor defies her husband by risking her life on an adventurous Crusade, and even challenges the Pope himself. And in young, brilliant, mercurial Henry d'Anjou, she finds her soul mate-the one man who is audacious enough to claim her for his own and make her Queen of England.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1f238b067489ff3e625c0ec5262ea7e60d02bf4","amp;dn":"Queen+Defiant+-+A+Novel+of+Eleanor+of+Aquitaine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1f238b067489ff3e625c0ec5262ea7e60d02bf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,242,56,176,103,72,159,243,230,37,192,236,82,98,234,126,96,208,43,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
