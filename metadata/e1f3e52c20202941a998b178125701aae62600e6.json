For $20,000 they break your legs. Axel Freed owes $44,000.&quot; \n\n\n\n\nAxel Freed is a New York City English professor with a gambling addiction that begins to spiral out of control. In the classroom, Freed inspires his college students with his interpretations of Dostoevsky's work. In his personal life, Axel has the affection of the beautiful Billie and the admiration of his family, including his mother Naomi, a doctor, and his grandfather, a wealthy businessman.\n \nUnbeknownst to them, Axel's reckless gambling on basketball games has left him with a huge debt. His bookie Hips likes the professor personally but threatens grave consequences if he doesn't pay up.\n \nAxel's descent into addiction requires him to extort a hefty $44,000 from his mortified mother to repay what he owes. He goes away with Billie to a casino where he makes a small fortune, only to blow it all again on basketball bets. He takes out his anger on Billie, who does not appreciate having loan sharks come to their apartment in the middle of the night. Expecting help from his grandfather, Axel gets nothing but the older man's disappointment and disgust.\n \nThe only solution left is to lure one of his students, a basketball star, into accepting a bribe to shave points in a game so that Axel can pay off his debts. Having corrupted a previously innocent youth, Axel is so appalled by his own behavior that he masochistically confronts a dangerous man which leaves him with a bloody and permanent reminder of his actions.\n\n\nAudio: English, French, Polish\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1f3e52c20202941a998b178125701aae62600e6","amp;dn":"The+Gambler+1974+DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1f3e52c20202941a998b178125701aae62600e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,243,229,44,32,32,41,65,169,152,177,120,18,87,1,170,230,38,0,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
