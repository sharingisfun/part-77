Their tremendous wave will add dimension to any surface. This wave, in fact, is the same on each flag so you can blend from one flag to the next and still maintain a nice smooth roll. Created at 222 inch long for large format graphics. An .eps cut contour is included for use as a cut path or clipping mask. Bonus Eagles are included in transparent .tiff format for the ultimate patriotic look.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e20ebd522e486db3b4b606199694c7bd5a174821","amp;dn":"Aurora+Graphics+Digital+Flags","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e20ebd522e486db3b4b606199694c7bd5a174821","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,14,189,82,46,72,109,179,180,182,6,25,150,148,199,189,90,23,72,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
