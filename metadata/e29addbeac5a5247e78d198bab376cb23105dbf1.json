Biologist David George Haskell uses a one-square-meter patch of old-growth Tennessee forest as a window onto the entire natural world. Visiting it almost daily for one year to trace nature's path through the seasons, he brings the forest and its inhabitants to vivid life. Beginning with simple observationsÃ¢â‚¬â€a salamander scuttling across the leaf litter, the first blossom of spring wildflowersÃ¢â‚¬â€Haskell spins a brilliant web of biology, ecology, and poetry, explaining the science binding together ecosystems that have cycled for thousandsÃ¢â‚¬â€sometimes millionsÃ¢â‚¬â€of years.
