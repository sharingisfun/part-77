It also appeared in a Radio Times poll to find the top 40 greatest TV shows on British television, published in August 2003.\n\nAbigail's Party is a play for stage and television written and directed in 1977 by Mike Leigh. It is a suburban situation comedy of manners, and a satire on the aspirations and tastes of the new middle class that emerged in Britain in the 1970s. The play developed in lengthy improvisations during which Mike Leigh explored the characters with the actors, but did not always reveal the incidents that would occur during the play. The production opened in April 1977 at the Hampstead Theatre, and returned after its initial run in the summer of 1977, 104 performances in all. A recording was arranged at the BBC as a Play for Today, produced by Margaret Matheson, and transmitted in November 1977.\n\nActors: Alison Steadman, Tim Stern, Janine Duvitski, John Salthouse, Harriet Reynolds \nDirectors: Mike Leigh \nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1 \nStudio: Water Bearer Films, Inc \nDVD Release Date: February 24, 2004 \nRun Time: 105 minutes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2b757f3452ab44f9bc3773c006c40add583f3ca","amp;dn":"Abigail%27s+Party","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2b757f3452ab44f9bc3773c006c40add583f3ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,183,87,243,69,42,180,79,155,195,119,60,0,108,64,173,213,131,243,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
