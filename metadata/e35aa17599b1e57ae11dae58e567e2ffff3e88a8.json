Date: June 1997\nISBN-13: 9780471183655\n288pp\nFormat: pdf\n\nWhat did the persecution of Galileo have to do with dolphins? Which famous astronomer was accused of piracy? Who made a car with an engine the size of a grain of rice? Feats of scientific discovery and achievement often include surprising twists, obscure connections, or ridiculous consequences. In Galileo and the Dolphins, you'll encounter true but amazing stories connected to advances in astronomy, botany, medicine, meteorology, and many other fields. \n\nFrom prehistoric killer tree'sÃ‚ï¿½ to contemporary computer imaging, from the depths of the ocean floor to the furthest reaches of outer space, Adrian Berry combs through regions, topics, and time periods to uncover the hard facts intertwined with superstition, intrigue, deceit, and sometimes murder (including the surprising phenomenon responsible for killing half the human race).\n\nQuoting everyone from Nostradamus to Al Gore, Galileo and the Dolphins assembles an extraordinary cast of scientists, bureaucrats, charlatans, true-believers, and cynics to support, debunk, or speculate on the mysteries of the universe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e35aa17599b1e57ae11dae58e567e2ffff3e88a8","amp;dn":"Galileo+And+The+Dolphins+-+Amazing+But+True+Stories+From+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e35aa17599b1e57ae11dae58e567e2ffff3e88a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,90,161,117,153,177,229,122,225,29,174,88,229,103,226,255,255,62,136,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
