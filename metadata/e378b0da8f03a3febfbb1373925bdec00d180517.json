Formed in 1985 by drummer/keyboardist Jan Kincaid, guitarist Simon Bartholomew, and bassist/keyboardist Andrew Levy -- longtime school friends from the London suburb of Ealing -- the BNH were originally an instrumental unit inspired by the James Brown and Meters records its members heard while clubbing the rare groove scene in vogue at the moment. The trio soon began recording their own music. One thing lead to another, and now, twenty years later the BNH are world famous, they have put out six great albums, many singles and an endless stream of hits. This album, called &quot;Elephantitis&quot;, compiles two and a half hours of incredible remixes, all taken straight off their commercial and promotional singles. Split right down the middle, the remixes, done by legends including Masters at Work (Kenny Dope and Louie Vega), Jay Dee, Davis Morales, Todd Terry, The Angel and Joey Negro, are divided into two catagories: Funk remixes and House remixes, all done between the years of 1991 through 1997. If you are, or ever were, a fan of the Brand New Heavies, this brilliant 26 song, double CD collection is a &quot;dream come true.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Amazon Reviews\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Never Stop (Extended Remix)\n[02] Stay This Way (Slam Mix)\n[03] Dream Come True 92 (Disco 2000 Mix)\n[04] Dream On Dreamer (Angel Extended Mix)\n[05] Back To Love (Opaz Radio Version)\n[06] Spend Some Time (Sweeny Club Mix)\n[07] Midnight At The Oasis (Opaz 7&quot; Version)\n[08] Mind Trips (Durham Remix)\n[09] Close To You (&quot;Pret-A-Porter&quot; Version)\n[10] Sometimes (Ummah Remix)\n[11] Shelter (Dobie's The Way It Should Be Mix)\n[12] You Are The Universe (Opaz Remix)\n[13] You Can Do It (Roc-A-Bloc Remix)\n[14] You've Got A Friend (Ballistic Brothers Remix)\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 01h:10m:21s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Stay This Way (The Club Mix)\n[02] Dream Come True 92 (Conversion Mix)\n[03] Dream on Dreamer (Heavies Motion Mix)\n[04] Back to Love (DJ Duke Mix)\n[05] Spend Some Time (Malone And Mollison Piano Mix)\n[06] Midnight at the Oasis (Roger's Brand New Radio Anthem)\n[07] Close to You (Masters at Work Remix Edit)\n[08] Sometimes (MAW Smooth Mix)\n[09] Shelter (Dan's Groove Part 1)\n[10] You Are the Universe (Curtis &amp; Moore's Universal Summer Groove 7&quot;)\n[11] You Can Do It (Mijangos Remix)\n[12] You've Got A Friend (Tee's Club Mix)\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 01h:15m:32s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............ 02h:25m:53s\nTotal File Size....................... 966mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
