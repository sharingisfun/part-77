She was accidentally stranded in the jungles of Africa for several months and survived by virtue of her ability to sound like a gorilla. She soon replaced her Western clothing with her trademark leopard-skin bikini. Even after being rescued by adventurer Dane Hunter, Pantha decided to stay in Africa to search for the mysterious white gorilla.\n\nGolden Age Appearances  \nThrilling Comics #56-74\n\n\nReal Name\nPantha\n\nFirst Appearance\nThrilling Comics #56 (Oct 1946)\n\nOriginal Publisher\nNedor\n\nby\nArt Saaf\n\nSeed for all to enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3f57a19d8b4fe5c90e35411fc1484d6ec335604","amp;dn":"Princess+Pantha+COMPLETE+1946+Thrilling+Comics+56-74","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3f57a19d8b4fe5c90e35411fc1484d6ec335604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,245,122,25,216,180,254,92,144,227,84,17,252,20,132,214,236,51,86,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
