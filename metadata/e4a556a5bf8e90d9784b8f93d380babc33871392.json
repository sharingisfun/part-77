People cannot travel unless they special travel permits issued by the totalitarian government, the &quot;Sphinx&quot;.\n\nOutside these cities, the desert has taken over and shanty towns are jammed with non-citizens - people without IDs forced to live primitive lives. William is a family man who works as a government investigator. When he is sent to Shanghai to solve a case of fake IDs, he meets a woman named Maria. \n\n\nDirector:\nMichael Winterbottom\n\nStarring:\nTim Robbins, Samantha Morton\n\nSoundtrack:\nDavid Holmes &amp; Steve Hilton (as Free Association)\n\n\nThis is a scene 720p HDTV rip released by the excellent release group DON, who also embedded English and Czech soft subtitles.\n\n\nIMDb: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0345061/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0345061/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4a556a5bf8e90d9784b8f93d380babc33871392","amp;dn":"Code.46.2003.720p.HDTV.x264-DON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4a556a5bf8e90d9784b8f93d380babc33871392","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,165,86,165,191,142,144,217,120,75,143,147,211,128,186,188,51,135,19,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
