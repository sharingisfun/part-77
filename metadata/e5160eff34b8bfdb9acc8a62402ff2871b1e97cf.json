Magical winged creatures flit around the icy bogland, albino animals hide themselves in the snow-glazed woods, and Ida Maclaird is slowly turning into glass. Ida is an outsider in these parts who has only visited the islands once before. Yet during that one fateful visit the glass transformation began to take hold, and now she has returned in search of a cure.\n\n&quot;The Girl with Glass Feet &quot;is a love story to treasure, Ã¢â‚¬Å“crafted with elegance and swept by passionate magic and the yearning for connection. A rare pleasureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Katherine Dunn, author of &quot;Geek Love&quot;).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5160eff34b8bfdb9acc8a62402ff2871b1e97cf","amp;dn":"The+Girl+With+Glass+Feet+-+Ali+Shaw.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5160eff34b8bfdb9acc8a62402ff2871b1e97cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,22,14,255,52,184,191,219,154,204,138,98,64,47,242,135,27,30,151,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
