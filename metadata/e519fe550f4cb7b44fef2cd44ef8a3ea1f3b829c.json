Sometimes we'll discuss something that just happened. Sometimes we'll talk about long-standing problems, concerns, or solutions. Either way, every week we endeavor to produce something interesting and important for every personal computer user. &quot; -grc.com/securitynow.htm\n\n\n\nI'm uploading episodes 1-425 in HQ (except for 219, the link was broken) in one torrent, because it's easier than going to their site and dl'ing each and every episode by hand.\n\nAll of the episodes EXCEPT 219 (Badly Broken Browsing) are in hq. Ironically enough, the link to the HQ version of ep.219 is the only one that's broken out of the HQ links.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e519fe550f4cb7b44fef2cd44ef8a3ea1f3b829c","amp;dn":"Security+Now%21+Podcast+with+Steve+Gibson+and+Leo+Laporte.+Ep.+1-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e519fe550f4cb7b44fef2cd44ef8a3ea1f3b829c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,25,254,85,15,76,183,180,79,239,44,212,78,248,163,234,31,59,130,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
