One married woman needs money to pay off her gambling debts and ward off a creep who demands sex until she can pay off what she owes. A young heroin addict needs money for her habit and get into all sorts of trouble. A student seduces her middle-aged English teacher to pass a course and now needs money for an abortion. And so on.\n\nShort vignettes tied together by the girls' common benefactor, Mister Mari, who is a very cynical and contemptuous philanthropist.\n\nSomewhat inappropriate Muzak is provided by &quot;Luristan.&quot;\n\nA few familiar faces from Doris Wishman films of the period. Directed by &quot;William Hennigar&quot; (whoever that is).\n\nNot a bad way to spend an hour.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5617de8fef189b005d61ed1c76a599d655dc8a1","amp;dn":"Mister+Mari%27s+Girls+%281967-SWV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5617de8fef189b005d61ed1c76a599d655dc8a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,97,125,232,254,241,137,176,5,214,30,209,199,106,89,157,101,93,200,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
