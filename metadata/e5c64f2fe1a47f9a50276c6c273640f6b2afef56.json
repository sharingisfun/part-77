Marina Marchese and Kim Flottum\nEnglish | 2013 | ISBN: 1579129293 | ISBN-13: 9781579129293 | 208 pages | EPUB | 18,5 MB\n\nFrom honey experts C. Marina Marchese, founder of Red Bee Ã‚Â® Honey and Kim Flottum, editor of Bee Culture Magazine comes this comprehensive introduction to the origin, flavor, and culinary uses of more than 30 varietals of honey, from ubiquitous clover to tangy star thistle to rich, smoky buckwheat.\n\nLike wine, cheese, coffee, and chocolate, honey has emerged as an artisanal obsession. Its popularity at farmers' markets and specialty food stores has soared as retailers are capitalizing on the trend. The Honey Connoisseur teaches consumers everything they need to know about how to taste, select, and use a diverse selection of honey.\n\nAfter a brief explanation of how bees produce honey, the authors introduce the concept of terroir, the notion that soil, weather, and other natural phenomena can affect the taste of honey. As with wines, knowing the terroir of a honey varietal helps to inform an understanding of its flavor.\nThe book goes on to give a thorough course in the origins of more than 30 different honeys as well as step-by-step instructions, how to taste honey, describe its flavor and determine what other flavors pair best with a particular honey. Also included are simple recipes such as dressings, marinades, quick-and-easy desserts, and beverages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5c64f2fe1a47f9a50276c6c273640f6b2afef56","amp;dn":"The+Honey+Connoisseur%3A+Selecting%2C+Tasting%2C+and+Pairing+Honey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5c64f2fe1a47f9a50276c6c273640f6b2afef56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,198,79,47,225,164,127,154,80,39,108,108,39,54,64,246,178,175,239,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
