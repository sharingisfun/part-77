David is looking for a chef who can blend with his staff and cook along the lines of his own trademark, whimsical style. David tests the chefs on ingredient utilization and then asks them to create their own theme night. When two are selected to run the restaurant for one dinner service, one chef battles their shyness to step up as a leader while the other has to course correct halfway through service to save their chances. Only one gets the job and becomes Fromagerie's next executive chef.\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 05-7-2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e61c71c24ac40e3f562ddef7fc6edb00567e19f9","amp;dn":"Chef.Wanted.S01E03.David.Burke.Fromagerie.HDTV.x264-FOOD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e61c71c24ac40e3f562ddef7fc6edb00567e19f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,28,113,194,74,196,14,63,86,45,222,247,252,110,219,0,86,126,25,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
