Leonard Hofstadter is a smart guy who tries his best to complete his research and become famous for his work while also attempting to be the most socially-interacting guy in their friend group. Sheldon Cooper is one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smartest men with an intellectual capacity through the roof and a language with scientific words normal people only have one comment to (Ã¢â‚¬Å“What?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½). Though itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been said by himself, all signs throughout the show point to him having the Asperger Syndrome, making him the smartest, but also least social, group member. Howard Wolowitz is an engineer with his mind partially on science, but mostly on women. He always tries his best to impress a girl and get his share of sexual intercourses, but he always manages to screw up somehow, probably with his bad knowledge of treating women in a bad matter. Rajesh Koothrappali is an Indian scientist performing experiments on black holes, outer space, life on other planets and not to mention string theory. Raj is mostly known for his Selective Mutism, in other words, his fear of speaking to women, making social interaction difficult for him. Finally, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Penny. Penny is the gorgeous girl next-door to Leonard and SheldonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apartment, and though she does not have any knowledge in physics or science, she makes success by being a funny character frequently having hilarious comments and on- and off-going relationships. All together, this unit of comedians make the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s half-hour episodes pure enjoyment and whether you like physics, women or neither, this show is surely going to get you laughing!\n\nThe release is prepared specially for iPhone/iPad\n\n\nAudio Ã¢â€žâ€“1: AAC, 2 channel, 48,0 KHz, 128 Kbps - Russian / Kuraj-Bambey (All Seasons)\nAudio Ã¢â€žâ€“2: AAC, 2 channel, 48,0 KHz, 128 Kbps - Russian / NTV (1 Season Only)\nAudio Ã¢â€žâ€“3: AAC, 2 channel, 48,0 KHz, 128 Kbps - Russian / STS (1-3 Season)\nAudio Ã¢â€žâ€“4: AAC, 2 channel, 48,0 KHz, 128 Kbps - Russian / BBC Saint-Petersburg (5 Season Only)\nAudio Ã¢â€žâ€“5: AAC, 2 channel, 48,0 KHz, 128 Kbps - Original / English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6546ae2603e4abe25145ac0b85d5e96d4d3bee0","amp;dn":"The+Big+Bang+Theory.+Season+1-6+%28Kuraj-Bambey%29+WEB-DLRip+480p+%28a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6546ae2603e4abe25145ac0b85d5e96d4d3bee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,84,106,226,96,62,74,190,37,20,90,192,184,93,94,150,212,211,190,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
