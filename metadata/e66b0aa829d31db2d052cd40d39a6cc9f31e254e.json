It simulates the space shuttleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach and landing in unprecedented detail and accuracy. Take command of the Orbiter during the final minutes of descent, and touchdown safely at the John F. Kennedy Space Center or Edwards Air Force Base.\n\nAfter the landing, you can watch a replay of your flight from different perspectives, like a chase plane or from the tower. A sophisticated landing analysis also is available, and only the best pilots are awarded a Ã¢â‚¬Å“perfect landingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ score.\n\nDownload it now and find out!\n\nThe OrbiterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach is seven times steeper and twice as fast compared to a commercial airlinerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach. Also, because during descent it is an unpowered glider, you only have one chance to get it right.\n\nThe included manual and tutorials will familiarize you with the head up display (HUD) and explain the different approach and landing phases. After some practice and your first successful touchdown, you can try crosswind or night landings.\n\nStriking realism\nFlight dynamics, the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems, and the HUD are simulated accurately and in great detail.\n\nFollow the guidance symbol in the HUD to stay on the heading alignment cone (HAC) and align the orbiter with the runway centerline, and then follow the flare reference symbol to perform the preflare maneuver. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget to keep an eye on the visual landing aids like the precision approach path indicators (PAPI) and the ball/bar light system to stay on the outer and inner glideslopes, respectively.\n\nLet the autopilot control rudder, speed brake, gear, and chute, or control them yourself. If you dare, simulate system failures like a stuck speed brake or HUD/guidance malfunctions.\n\nA wide range of options\nTake your place in the commanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seat in the stunning virtual cockpit, or view your flight from different external camera perspectives. Choose between accelerometer (tilt) controls or (virtual) analog sticks to steer the Orbiter. Land on both shuttle landing facilities, and fly either final or full approaches by selecting one of the four possible HACs. Configure day or night landings, clear or overcast skies, visibility, wind, and many other parameters.\n\nAchievements and leaderboards\nIt will take some practice, but your first safe, good, and perfect landings are rewarded with OpenFeint achievements. A total of 15 medals and badges are waiting for the top astronauts, and you can unlock two secret, hidden achievements. Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve become an expert space shuttle commander, compare your scores on the online leaderboards with the best pilots in the world.\n\nA number one title\nF-Sim Space Shuttle has received rave reviews from flight simulation enthusiasts across the world and is ranked among the best simulations on the iOS App Store.\n\nThis Android version is based on version 2.0 of the iOS app, with some features added from versions 2.2 and 2.4. We will add more features in future updates.\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tested this version extensively on a large number of Android devices. If you still run into problems, please let us know and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do our best to fix them.\n\nWhat's New: (Updated : Aug 15, 2013)\n\nA lot of improvements, including:\n\n- Chute\n- Wingtip vortices\n- New camera perspectives\n- Switch between camara perspectives in replay\n- Display score at end of flight\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tested this version extensively on a large number of devices.
