Before long, however, she realizes that her feelings for this charismatic, extremely guarded stranger are far from straightforward. In the meantime, her troubled teenage patient, Annie, runs away from home and soon will reinvent herself in New York as an aspiring and ruthless actress, as unencumbered as humanly possible by any personal attachments. \n\nAnd Mitch, GraceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ex-husband, who is a therapist as well, leaves the woman heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s desperately in love with to attend to a struggling native community in the bleak Arctic. We follow these four compelling, complex characters from Montreal and New York to Hollywood and Rwanda, each of them with a consciousness that is utterly distinct and urgently convincing. \n\nWith razor-sharp emotional intelligence, Inside poignantly explores the many dangers as well as the imperative of making ourselves available toÃ¢â‚¬â€and responsible forÃ¢â‚¬â€those dearest to us.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e67e225fbd9a115fd9875e349ee9ff2cfdb5ff3d","amp;dn":"Inside+by+Alix+Ohlin+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e67e225fbd9a115fd9875e349ee9ff2cfdb5ff3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,126,34,95,189,154,17,95,217,135,94,52,158,233,255,44,253,181,255,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
