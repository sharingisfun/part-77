It was released on 29 June 1999 through Roadrunner Records, following a demo containing a few of the songs which had been released in 1998, and was reissued in December 1999 with a slightly altered track listing and mastering as the result of a lawsuit. It was the first release by the band to be produced by Ross Robinson, who sought to refine Slipknot's sound rather than alter the group's musical direction. The album spans several genres, but is generally noted for its extensive percussion and overall heavy sound. It was well received by fans and critics alike and was responsible for bringing Slipknot a large increase in popularity. The album peaked at number 51 on the Billboard 200, and has gone on to become certified double platinum in the United States, making it the band's best selling album.\n\n\n \t\t00 slipknot album art 01.JPG\t66.32 KB\n \t\t00 slipknot album art 02.JPG\t71.44 KB\n \t\t01 742617000027.flac\t3.48 MB\n \t\t02 (sic).flac\t24.32 MB\n \t\t03 Eyeless.flac\t29.52 MB\n \t\t04 Wait and Bleed.flac\t19.17 MB\n \t\t05 Surfacing.flac\t28.28 MB\n \t\t06 Spit It Out.flac\t21.4 MB\n \t\t07 Tattered &amp; Torn.flac\t20.3 MB\n \t\t08 Frail Limb Nursery.flac\t4.02 MB\n \t\t09 Purity.flac\t32.07 MB\n \t\t10 Liberate.flac\t22.99 MB\n \t\t11 Prosthetics.flac\t35.61 MB\n \t\t12 No Life.flac\t21.14 MB\n \t\t13 Diluted.flac\t25.51 MB\n \t\t14 Only One.flac\t17.37 MB\n \t\t15 Scissors.flac\t59.78 MB\n \t\t16 Me Inside.flac\t20.3 MB\n \t\t17 Get This.flac\t15.22 MB\n \t\t18 Interloper (Demo).flac\t16.72 MB\n \t\t19 Despise (Demo) (includes Eeyore).flac\t61.27 MB\n \t\tSlipknot - Slipknot .m3u\t1.07 KB\n \t\tSlipknot.cue\t3 KB\n \t\tz audiochecker.log\t1.08 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker main log file.log\t4.61 KB\n General\n\nFile size                                : 478 MiB\nAlbum                                    : Slipknot - Slipknot (Australian Edition Bonus Tracks) \nTrack name/Total                         : 19\nComposer                                 : Slipknot \nGenre                                    : nuMetal\nRecorded date                            : 1999\n\n\n\n===========================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nFormat/Info                              : Free Lossless Audio Codec\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 813 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44 KHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e72dcdee51daf077ed9d6c1c324a6c39b1671ec2","amp;dn":"Slipknot+-+Slipknot+%28Australian+Edition+Bonus+Tracks%29+%28flac%29+%5BMe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e72dcdee51daf077ed9d6c1c324a6c39b1671ec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,45,205,238,81,218,240,119,237,157,108,28,50,74,108,57,177,103,30,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
