It's one of the better WWII games out there and I had yet to find a decent rip of it online. So I made one myself so I could install and use ISO hacks, and for pure nostalgia reasons. \n\nI didn't Stealth Patch the original file so make sure to run it through ABGX360 before playing the game. Since this is an XDG2 game, it should be compatible with any LT+ firmware if burned correctly.\n\nCall of Duty 3 is a World War II first-person shooter and the third installment in the Call of Duty video game series first released on November 7, 2006. It has been released for the PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360. It has also been released on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.[1]\nThis game was a launch title for the PS3 and Wii in North America, Europe and Australia. It was also the only major Call of Duty installment not to be released for personal computer platforms and the only numerical sequel to date to have been a console-exclusive game alongside Call of Duty 2: Big Red One and Call of Duty: Finest Hour. It was also the second installment in the Call of Duty series to be developed by Treyarch after Big Red One.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e763483f68f27db3b6b260ca78c7d46424675f7b","amp;dn":"Call.Of.Duty.3.Xbox360.RF.SF56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e763483f68f27db3b6b260ca78c7d46424675f7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,99,72,63,104,242,125,179,182,178,96,202,120,199,212,100,36,103,95,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
