Billions perished. \n\nThe planet Earth was turned into a virtual graveyard, with the shattered, burned-out skeletons of great cities serving as tombstones marking MankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demise. But in the United States, one final outpost remains. Ten years have passed, and Harmony Base, a subterranean U.S. Army installation that survived the nuclear inferno, has yet to receive any response to its continual radio transmissions. Long-range surface reconnaissance missions fail to locate any other survivors. HarmonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personnel, a mix of military and civilian specialists, wonder if they are the only living beings left on the planet. Earthquake damage to the baseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vital power plant necessitates a different type of mission: the retrieval of spare parts from a storage depot in San Jose, 1,600 miles distant. \n\nCaptain Mike Andrews and his crew set out across a Giger-inspired landscape blighted by lightning storms and deadly hazards that could swallow their all-terrain vehicles whole. The last thing Andrews expects to encounter in the nuked ruins of San Jose are survivors led by a twisted freak with mental powers off the scale... Harmony is AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last chance to rise up from the ashes of the nuclear holocaust and help restore civilization. But only if Andrews and his crew can escape San JoseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and the madman who calls himself The Law.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e78904f54619df525494c552296852cbdbd62631","amp;dn":"Earthfall+by+Stephen+Knight.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e78904f54619df525494c552296852cbdbd62631","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,137,4,245,70,25,223,82,84,148,197,82,41,104,82,203,219,214,38,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
