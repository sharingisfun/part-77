Frost is a tremendous songwriter and a poignant lyricist, as well as a wonderfully expressive singer; her music is both fresh and strangely familiar, and her best efforts -- &quot;Temporary Loan,&quot; &quot;Pony Song,&quot; and the stunning &quot;Give up Your Love&quot; -- are powerful expressions of soul-baring beauty. A stellar debut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7cbb44354b0c542ca999676c3001241c7696e68","amp;dn":"Edith+Frost+-+Calling+Over+Time+%5B1997%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7cbb44354b0c542ca999676c3001241c7696e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,203,180,67,84,176,197,66,202,153,150,118,195,0,18,65,199,105,110,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
