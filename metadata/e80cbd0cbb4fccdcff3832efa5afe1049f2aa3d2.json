The first (David Rand) appeared in pulp magazines of the 1930s, and was adapted for his second iteration, as a comic book character for Timely Comics, the 1930s and 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. The second and more prominent (Kevin Plunder) is a heroic character in the Marvel Comics Universe.\n\nThe second Ka-Zar started as a similar character, but reminiscent of both Tarzan and of writer-artist Joe Kubert's 1950s caveman character, Tor. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in The X-Men #10 (March 1965), he lives in the dinosaur-populated Savage Land, which was hidden beneath Antarctica by extraterrestrials.\nOriginally written as a primitive and belligerent savage who spoke in broken English, Ka-Zar later became more articulate and civilized, although he retained a certain degree of distrust toward civilization and was generally wary of outside visitors to the Savage Land. Kevin Plunder refers to himself as the &quot;Lord of the Savage Land&quot;, a phrase others have adopted, but this is not a formal title.\nHe has had four self-titled series, the first published in 1970Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1971 (three issues, mostly reprints), the second in 1974-1977 (20 issues) by Mike Friedrich, the third in 1981-1984 (Ka-Zar the Savage, 34 issues) by Bruce Jones and Mike Carlin, and the fourth in 1997-1998 (20 issues) written by Mark Waid.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e80cbd0cbb4fccdcff3832efa5afe1049f2aa3d2","amp;dn":"Ka-Zar+the+Savage+%23+1-20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e80cbd0cbb4fccdcff3832efa5afe1049f2aa3d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,12,189,12,187,79,204,220,255,56,50,239,165,175,225,4,159,42,163,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
