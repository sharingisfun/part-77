In this part we will see and address from the scriptures what the Lord wants us to know about time. With this Biblical awareness established in our minds we need to know that there is a threat using time that is part of the end time deceptions from the enemy of God and mankind. This is the first of it's kind in presenting you this Biblical understanding of Time Travel.\n\nA man and a nation were the first to discover how to travel time. The story is here with all the scripture to support this. My own personal investigation has discovered a cover up in the US that ties into this presentation.\n\nPart 3:\nFirstborn of his own kind the worst people have discovered how to travel time and clone themselves to a false sense of eternal life and think they can be like God, all present, all knowing and all powerful. America has followed down the same path. See how this follows a Biblical pattern of the same but opposite.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTime Travel:\nshieldoftheseason goes over the ins and outs of time travel - what is being done and its limitations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSigns - Part 27:\nA compilation of various short clips presenting the apocalyptic signs which are occurring around the world today and help us identify the state of affairs ushering the end of days.

Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e893d134d94db9aa9a47aee59f3f9646311aece8","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+End+Times+-+43+-+Time+Travel+in+the+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e893d134d94db9aa9a47aee59f3f9646311aece8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,147,209,52,217,77,185,170,154,71,174,229,159,63,150,70,49,26,236,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
