Hindley's later confession that she and Brady had lied in an attempt to reduce their sentences did little to diminish the slurs against his name.\n\n\n\nFor over four decades, Smith was asked by writers and film-makers to tell his story. Apart from a handful of brief interviews, he always refused. Carol Ann Lee met Smith during her research for One of Your Own, her critically acclaimed biography of Hindley, following which he finally agreed to reveal all.\n\n\n\nIn Evil Relations (previously published as Witness), interviews, archival research and, most significantly, David Smith's own vivid memoir are fused to create an unforgettable, often harrowing account of his life before, during and after the Moors Murders.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e98ce444e83a3f1fe64cb677b5055d6f2e53d1d2","amp;dn":"Evil+Relations+%28formerly+published+as+Witness%29+-+The+Man+Who+Bor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e98ce444e83a3f1fe64cb677b5055d6f2e53d1d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,140,228,68,232,58,63,31,230,76,182,119,181,5,93,111,46,83,209,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
