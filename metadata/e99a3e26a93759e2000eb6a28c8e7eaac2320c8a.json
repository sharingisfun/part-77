Chain Letters, the pair's January 22 album on Saddle Creek, clearly indicates they went with Option B. &quot;We were sitting around in a bedroom playing really loud with no drums, just kind of trusting that it was going to make sense once we put it all together&quot; says Chris. &quot;Hopefully we landed closer to mid-'70's Iggy Pop than Leonard Cohen this time.&quot; The Senseney's may not have fully achieved their dream sound of &quot;Cohen fronting The Pixies&quot; -- the mellow folk heart of songs like &quot;Bar All The Doors&quot; surfaces now and then -- but the freewheeling Chain Letters is shot through with grit and tension, Stefanie's prominent fuzz bass lines and Chris' loose-limbed baritone driving tracks like the ragged, wall-of-sound epic &quot;You Can't Save 'em All&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e99a3e26a93759e2000eb6a28c8e7eaac2320c8a","amp;dn":"Big+Harp+-+Chain+Letters+%5B2013%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e99a3e26a93759e2000eb6a28c8e7eaac2320c8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,154,62,38,169,55,89,226,0,14,182,162,140,142,126,170,194,50,12,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
