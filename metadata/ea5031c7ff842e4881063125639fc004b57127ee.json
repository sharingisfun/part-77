It was released on &quot;commercial&quot; CD bootleg &quot;Follow Me To Gamehendge&quot; which apparently everyone in the universe had a cassette copy of in the mid-1990's.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea5031c7ff842e4881063125639fc004b57127ee","amp;dn":"Phish+-+Stanford+University+1992%2F04%2F18++%5BSBD%5D++%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea5031c7ff842e4881063125639fc004b57127ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,80,49,199,255,132,46,72,129,6,49,37,99,159,192,4,181,113,39,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
