The rules state as a general suggestion, average video bitrate in excess of 5000kb/s is a sign that a higher CRF value should be chosen, when possible. Top Gear being a competitive reality series qualifies for CRF 22.We also used a very mild softener and very slow preset for extra compression while still maintaining a quality picture. We hope the other folks take a lesson on this because let's be honest - 2GB for 44 minutes of video is ridiculous.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebab1ebfff900fcb6eb9c3a10338fd247959937b","amp;dn":"Top.Gear.US.S04E03.PROPER.720p.HDTV.x264-DHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebab1ebfff900fcb6eb9c3a10338fd247959937b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,171,30,191,255,144,15,203,110,185,195,161,3,56,253,36,121,89,147,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
