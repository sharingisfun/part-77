No matter what you do, you cannot \n\nget rid of this annoying &amp; irritating syndrome.\n\n\n\nThis can happen for a number of reasons eg. Virus, Installing a software that \n\nchanges the default fonts, Corrupted Fonts etc.\n\nThe default Fonts are either replaced, corrupted or damaged.\n\nThere is no ready solution to this problem either with Microsoft or with the \n\neffected browsers Websites. The solutions offered are meaningless or vague. They \n\ndo not solve the problem.\n\n\nThe only sure shot solution is to :\n\nGo to Start - Control Panel - Fonts Folder - Open Fonts Folder (as Administrator, \n\nif necessary) - Copy / Paste / Replace with Default System Fonts. Restart Windows.\n\n\n\nThe Damaged / Corrupted Fonts will be replaced and all your Fonts will be reset \n\nwith default.\n\n\n\nI had a similar problem long ago in Win XP, when I stumbled upon this method in a \n\nBlog on the Net. Since then, I always Backup my Fonts after a fresh install of \n\nWindows. This saved my butt a few days ago when my Fonts on Windows 7 went wonky. \n\nI don't remember which blog it was, but Thank the Blogger once again for this \n\nuseful and life saving Tip.\n\n\n(If an installed software created this problem, be sure to uninstall it before \n\nfollowing the procedure above).\n\n\n\nThought I would share with you so that somewhere, sometime this may come in handy \n\nto someone.\n\n=============================================================================\n\nSEED AND ENJOY !\n\nTHE UPLOADS  ARE VIRUS / MALWARE FREE.\n\nALL CREDIT TO AN ARMY OF UPLOADERS / CRACKERS / REVERSERS\n\nLEAVE COMMENTS FOR OTHER DOWNLOADERS TO REFER.\n\nAND REMEMBER TO ENJOY !
