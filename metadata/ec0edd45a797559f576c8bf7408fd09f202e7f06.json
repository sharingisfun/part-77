The debut album was done in the style of FOREIGNER, Fritsch and singer sang in the best tradition of Lou Gramm (Lou Gramm, FOREIGNER) and Joe Lynn Turner (Joe Lynn Turner, RAINBOW). In America, the group went unnoticed, but in England it is appreciated. The debut was re-released it a year later and backed by a club tour. CBS chose to complete his collaboration with the band, but the new contract will not take long - was saved by a British company Music For Nations. Second album Drivin1 Wheel was designed in a hard style to his writing Mangold drew guitarist Tony Bruno (Tony Bruno, SARAYA), bassist Paul St. James (Paul St. James), guitarist Rick Kolstnera (Rick Kolstner), guitarist Ray detonation (Ray DeTone) and vocalists Bernie Mardonsa (Benny Mardones), Aldo Nova and Fiona.
