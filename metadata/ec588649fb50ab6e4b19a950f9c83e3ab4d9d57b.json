In addition to creating a unique musical sound, he has won praise for his power as a lyricist. His precisely worded narratives, with their sense of humour about daily life, stand as metaphors for the social and economic ills that bedevil his country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec588649fb50ab6e4b19a950f9c83e3ab4d9d57b","amp;dn":"Oliver+Mutukudzi_NHAVA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec588649fb50ab6e4b19a950f9c83e3ab4d9d57b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,88,134,73,251,80,171,110,75,25,169,80,249,200,62,58,180,217,213,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
