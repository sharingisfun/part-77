In the 1920s taught spanish literature in the u. of Cambridge and in the 1930s was ambassador of the Spanish Republic in the Society of nations.\n\nAll this gave him a first hand knowledge of european affairs and social psychology in one of the most foolish of times.\n\nThe book is a subjective depiction of Europe , half literature , half history.\n\n\n\nFOREWORD\n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;THREATENED from without and from within, from amechanized Jenghiz Khan in Moscow, and from her ownself-destructive inner tendencies, Europe is in mortal danger.That is why we are awakening to our love for her.Whether she will survive or perish depends above all onwhether she becomes aware of herself vividly enough torealize that she lives, and, therefore, that she must live.The situation may be briefly putas follows : the men and nations of Europe are already woven by the material circumstances of their lives into a close physical soli darity, such as that which welds together into a ribbon all the cars circulating on a narrow road.\nBut, just as the hundreds of drivers of those cars are perhaps in their hearts wishing each other in hell, the men and nations of Europe are still totally lacking in moral solidarity.

To which may be argued that the United States have absentmindedly stumbled into the most wonderful name of all, which may be read on the uniforms of their soldiers :\nU.S.\nUS, we, that is, the mystic word which expresses collective awareness. During the last war, a toothless, tottering, old woman was heard to say: &quot;Last night we bombed Berlin.&quot; \n\nBy the mystic power of that we, she, the human ruin, had sharedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦&quot;&quot;&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecc8a10b4c076f543908ffadd247637b4ff3b030","amp;dn":"Portrait+of+Europe+.-+Salvador+de+Madariaga+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecc8a10b4c076f543908ffadd247637b4ff3b030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,200,161,11,76,7,111,84,57,8,255,173,210,71,99,123,79,243,176,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
