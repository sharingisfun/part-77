But she has to admitÃ¢â‚¬â€to this day, no other man has ever been able to replace him in her fantasies.\n\nLisaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not alone in her desires. Rick has not only wanted to reignite the flame that he and Lisa once had together, but maybe even throw a few new kinks into the fire. On a tropical island getaway, they plan to test the watersÃ¢â‚¬â€which means risking a hard won friendship for something more. For something wild.
