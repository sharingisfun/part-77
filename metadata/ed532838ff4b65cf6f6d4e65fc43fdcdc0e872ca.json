Despite his dedication to the junior-high students who fill his classroom, idealistic teacher Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) leads a secret life that the majority of his students will never know. When Dunne's drug-soaked nightlife begins to bleed over into his daytime hours and troubled student Drey (Shareeka Epps) makes a startling discovery, the tenuous bond that forms between the pair soon leads to a warm friendship that could either lead them down a dangerous path or provide the human companionship needed to see things from a fresh perspective and start life anew.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed532838ff4b65cf6f6d4e65fc43fdcdc0e872ca","amp;dn":"Half+Nelson+2006+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed532838ff4b65cf6f6d4e65fc43fdcdc0e872ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,83,40,56,255,75,101,207,111,109,78,101,252,67,253,205,192,232,114,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
