Lewis\nStars: John Savage, Kelly Reno, IldikÃƒÂ³ BÃƒÂ¡nsÃƒÂ¡gi\n\nBrady is an airman shot down during World War II over the Hungarian Plateau who is hidden by the local people. They are ranchers, occupied by the Germans who speak very little English, thus most of the film is communicated by action. Brady and a boy from the village try to go by horseback across country and avoid the German patrols long enough to reach neutral territory. \n\nReview:\n\nGiven the low budget and production limitations, this movie is very good. It is plausible, realistic, and shows how the Csikos (Hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains (puszta) risked their lives to save a downed American pilot from the ruthless and savage Nazis. We are drawn into strong feelings for the young, impressionable, yet highly courageous boy--who admires the American pilot. If you're looking for special effects, superman heroes, and magical endings--this movie is not for you. If you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent, amoral Nazis and their lack of compassion, then you will be enthralled by this movie. I truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses, dogs, and humble, helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end, this movie will be one you'll remember for a long time.\n\nPLEASE NOTE, THIS IS A DECENT QUALITY VHS-RIP!
