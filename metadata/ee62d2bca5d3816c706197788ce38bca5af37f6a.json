On a PC running Windows XP or Windows Vista, a third-party program is required to convert an ISO file into installable mediaÃ¢â‚¬â€and DVD burning software often includes this capability.\n\nImportant \n\nIf you decide that you want to install Windows 8.1 Preview using the ISO, you won't be able to uninstall it. If you decide to go back to your previous operating system, you'll need to reinstall it using the recovery or installation media that came with your PC, which is typically DVD media. If you're running Windows 8 and you don't have recovery media, you might be able to create a USB recovery drive. If you're running Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP and you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have recovery media, you might be able to create it from a recovery partition on your PC using software provided by your PC manufacturer. Check the support section of your PC manufacturerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s website for more information. After you install Windows 8.1 Preview, you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be able to use the recovery partition on your PC to go back to your previous version of Windows.\n\nNotes before you download \n\nWindows 8.1 Preview is prerelease software that may be substantially modified before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commercially released.
