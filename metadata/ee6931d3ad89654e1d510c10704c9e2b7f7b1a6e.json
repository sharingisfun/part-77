Between being part of a disfunctional police department and having a vain and demanding lover who Michael suspects is only using him for personal gain, it's all Michael can do to keep himself sane. When the body of Craig Davies, a wealthy defense lawyer, is found on former television star Sam Christiansen's front lawn, Michael knows that everyone-his bosses, his partner at the police department, and Brian, his lover-will be looking to him for solutions. Despite a quick solution that results in a dead suspect, the case turns out to be much more complex than it first appears. Michael uncovers a twisted web of relationships, a web that inexorably draws him into a passionate tangle of love and greed where more and more people are turning up dead. It's critical that Michael find justice for Sam as their attraction grows... but it will take a back seat to keeping them both alive.\nGenre: Mystery Romance MM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee6931d3ad89654e1d510c10704c9e2b7f7b1a6e","amp;dn":"Billionaire%27s+Row+-+Sullivan+Wheeler.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee6931d3ad89654e1d510c10704c9e2b7f7b1a6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,105,49,211,173,137,101,78,29,81,12,16,112,76,158,43,127,123,26,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
