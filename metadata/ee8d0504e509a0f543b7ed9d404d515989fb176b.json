Watson is shocked, having heard nothing about his friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illness. Mrs. Hudson says that he has neither eaten nor drunk anything in three days. Upon arriving, Watson finds Holmes in his bed looking very ill and gaunt indeed, and Holmes proceeds to make several odd demands of Watson. He is not to come near Holmes, for the illness is highly contagious. He will seek no help save from the man whom Holmes names. He will wait until six oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢clock before Holmes names him. When Watson objects and tries to leave for help, Holmes musters enough strength to leap out of bed, and lock the door, taking the key. So, Watson is forced to wait. Holmes seems delirious at times. Watson examines several objects in HolmesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s room while he waits. Holmes has a fit when Watson touches one item, a little black and white ivory box with a sliding lid. Holmes orders him to put it down, explaining that he does not like his things touched.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee8d0504e509a0f543b7ed9d404d515989fb176b","amp;dn":"The+Adventure+of+the+Dying+Detective+by+Sir+Arthur+Conan+Doyle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee8d0504e509a0f543b7ed9d404d515989fb176b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,141,5,4,229,9,160,245,67,183,237,157,64,77,81,89,137,251,23,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
