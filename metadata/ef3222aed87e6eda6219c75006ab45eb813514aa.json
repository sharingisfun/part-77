This is not an upmix, this is a discrete mix from the original multi-tracks, authorized by Secret Friend. This release is also freely available from their website: http://secretfriend.com.au/time-machine-5dot1/\n\nThe PDF file included with this release is not allowed on TPB, but you can downliad it separately from the link above.\n\nFrom the album liner notes:\nSecret Friend's debut album, &quot;Time Machine&quot;, was released 8 January 2013. Produced in Los Angeles by Linus of Hollywood, the performers include some of LAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best studio musicians and singers: Kelly Jones and Willie Wisely on vocals, Bob Remstein (Mello Cads), Ben Romans (The Click Five), Roger Joseph Manning Jr. (Jellyfish, Beck) on keyboards, Carson Cohen on bass guitar, Reade Pryor on drums, and arrangements by John Hill (Margo Guryan).\n\nThe music bears influences from the usual pop suspects Ã¢â‚¬â€œ McCartney, Brian Wilson, Bacharach, ABBA, Nilsson, plus some surprising jazz and latin instrumentation. For certain, &quot;Time Machine&quot; is not your typical indie-pop album - the twelve songs here cover a lot of musical ground and with each song the album reveals another unexpected and refreshing twist of melody and arrangement, whilst a somewhat dark and twisted sense of humour infuses the lyrics at the most unexpected moments.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://secretfriend.com.au/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://secretfriend.com.au/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef3222aed87e6eda6219c75006ab45eb813514aa","amp;dn":"Secret+Friend+-+Time+Machine+Surround+Sampler+%282013%29+%5B5.1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef3222aed87e6eda6219c75006ab45eb813514aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,50,34,174,216,126,110,218,98,25,199,80,6,171,69,235,129,53,20,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
