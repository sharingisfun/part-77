This also means that there is no custom interface on the instruments (but at least you can still use it!).\n\nThis is NOT the expanded (EXP) version of the library!\n\nAlso, this one is packaged in .7z format, instead of being uncompressed. This is because there were too many files, which made the torrent too large for TBP.\n\nUnless you really need to, please do not delete the .7z file once you have extracted it, so that you can seed, which will help other people in the same way that I have (hopefully) helped you :)\n\n\nTorrent Contents:\n==================\n\n7-Zip Archive, containing:\n\n  Custom Kontakt Library\n  Samples\n\n\nInstallation:\n==============\n\nExtract, then add the extracted folder as a library to (cracked) Kontakt.\n\n\nProduct Info:\n==============\n\nProjectSAMs Organ Mystique features a beautifully sampled, intimate and, at times, haunted sounding church organ, covering multi-samples of seven distinct keyboard stops, three bass stops and, as you have come to expect of ProjectSAM, a range of unique special effects.\n\nSAM Organ Mystique is located in a church near a small Dutch village. During WOII, a German airplane crashed into the church, tearing down the front part and killing brave members of the resistance. Although beautifully restored, some of the walls still bear the scars of this sad, historic day. The villagers say, when the organ is played, you can still hear it weep for the fallen soldiers of 1944.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efc2dc56f24bcb4a3176c11ab51dec97f6a69d56","amp;dn":"Project+SAM+-+Organ+Mystique+%5BCUSTOM+KONTAKT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efc2dc56f24bcb4a3176c11ab51dec97f6a69d56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,194,220,86,242,75,203,74,49,118,193,26,181,29,236,151,246,166,157,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
