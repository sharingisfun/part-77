Considering that these were all originally released on 78s and that the latter scarcely ever showed up on LP reissues in the United States, this is the first and best opportunity that Americans will have to hear most of the songs here. Apart from the quality of the sound reproduction, which is excellent, the most striking element of this set must be the concentration of wit within its tracks. Coward was a dazzling wit, and that element of his work is undiminished by the passage of decades. It's almost impossible not to delight in the play and cleverness of Coward's words every bit as much as he did, where his own songs are concerned, or the personal touch that he adds to songs such as &quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band&quot; or &quot;Everybody's Doing It Now.&quot; The accompanying booklet, which includes a complete Coward sessionography, supplies the background on the songs and the recordings (sometimes a bit sketchily), but even without the details filled in, the material stands on its own as a source of pleasure. It's also fascinating to hear the evolution of his work over time and the more personal and overtly romantic work that emerged from his pen after World War II. Ideally, this set would be the accompaniment to any documentary on Coward's life; for reasons best-known to themselves, however, EMI deleted it in 1999, but it can still be found second-hand, and is worth tracking down.\n\n01 - A Room With View\n02 - Dance, Little Lady\n03 - Mary Make-Believe\n04 - Try To Learn To Love\n05 - Lorelei\n06 - The Dream Is Over\n07 - Zigeuner\n08 - World Weary\n09 - Private Lives Love Scene Act I-Scene From Act 2\n10 - Half-Cast Woman\n11 - Any Little Fish\n12 - Cavalcade Prologue Soldiers Of The Queen-Goodbye Dolly Gray-Private Tommy Atkins...\n13 - Cavalcade-Vocal Selection Part I Soldiers Of The Queen-Goodbye Dolly Gray-Lover Of My Dreams...\n14 - Lover Of My Dreams (Mirabelle Waltz)\n15 - Cavalcade-Vocal Selection Part 2 Let's All Go Down The Strand-If You Were The Only Girl-Take Me...\n16 - Cavalcade Epilogue Alexander's Ragtime Band-Everybody's Doing It-Pack Up Your Troubles-It's A...\n17 - Noel Coward Medley Part I Intro-Parisian Pierrot-Poor Little Rich Girl-A Room With A View-Dance...\n18 - Noel Coward medley Part 2 Intro-Someday I Will Find You- Any Little Fish-If You Could Only Come...\n19 - Let's Say Goodbye\n20 - The Party's Over Now\n21 - Something To Do With Spring\n22 - Mad Dogs And Englishmen\n23 - Medley Tokay-World Weary-Caballero-Green Carnation-I'll See You Again-Poor Little Rich Girl...\n24 - I'll Follow My Secret Heart\n25 - Melanie's Aria Part I\n26 - Melanie's Aria Part II\n27 - I Travel Alone\n28 - Most Ev'ry Day\n29 - Love In Bloom\n30 - Fare Thee Well\n31 - Mrs Worthington\n32 - We Were So Young\n33 - Then Play, Orchestra, Play\n34 - You Were there\n35 - Has Anybody Seen Our Ship\n36 - Man About Town\n37 - Family Album\n38 - Parisian Pierrot\n39 - We Were Dancing\n40 - Dearest Love\n41 - Where Are The Songs We Sung\n42 - The Stately Homes of England\n43 - Gipsy Melody\n44 - Dearest love (Operette)\n45 - I'll See You Again\n46 - Just Let Me Look At You\n47 - Poor Little Rich Girl\n48 - London Pride\n49 - The Last Time I Saw Paris\n50 - Could You Please Oblige Us With Bren Gun\n51 - There Have Been Songs In England\n52 - Imagine The Duchess's Feelings!\n53 - It's Only You\n54 - Don't Let's Be Beastly To The Germans\n55 - The Welcoming Land\n56 - I'm Old Fashioned\n57 - You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To\n58 - Sigh No More\n59 - I Wonder What Happened To Him\n60 - Matelot\n61 - Nina\n62 - Never Again\n63 - Wait A Bit, Joe\n64 - Bright Was the Day\n65 - This Is A Changing World\n66 - His Exellency Regrets\n67 - One, Two, Three\n68 - Uncle Harry\n69 - I Never Knew\n70 - I Saw No Shadow\n71 - Josephine\n72 - Don'\n73 - Sail Away\n74 - Noel Coward Medley-Part I I'll See You Again-Dance Little Lady-Poor Little Rich Girl-...\n75 - Noel Coward Medley-Part II Any Little Fish- You Were There-Someday I'll Find You\n76 - Why Does Love Get In The Way\n77 - I Like America\n78 - Time And Again\n79 - There Are Bad Times Just Around The Corner\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f139cce601d48bb170690f9dd20d72b1bebfc172","amp;dn":"No%26euml%3Bl+Coward+-+The+Master%27s+Voice+-+1928+to+1953+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f139cce601d48bb170690f9dd20d72b1bebfc172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,57,204,230,1,212,139,177,112,105,15,157,210,13,114,177,190,191,193,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
