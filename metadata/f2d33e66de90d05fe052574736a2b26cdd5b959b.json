Scores of Jewish prophets, preachers, and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land, bearing messages from God. This was the age of zealotryÃ¢â‚¬â€a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews. And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchy.\n\nBalancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious Ã¢â‚¬Å“King of the JewsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime. Aslan explores the reasons why the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity.\n\nZealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus of NazarethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and mission. The result is a thought-provoking, elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast-paced novel: a singularly brilliant portrait of a man, a time, and the birth of a religion.\n\nAdvance praise for Zealot\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A bold, powerfully argued revisioning of the most consequential life ever lived.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Lawrence Wright, Pulitzer PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning author of Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The story of Jesus of Nazareth is arguably the most influential narrative in human history. Here Reza Aslan writes vividly and insightfully about the life and meaning of the figure who has come to be seen by billions as the Christ of faith. This is a special and revealing work, one that believer and skeptic alike will find surprising, engaging, and original.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Jon Meacham, Pulitzer PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning author of Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In Zealot, Reza Aslan doesn't just synthesize research and reimagine a lost world, though he does those things very well. He does for religious history what Bertolt Brecht did for playwriting. Aslan rips Jesus out of all the contexts we thought he belonged in and holds him forth as someone entirely new. This is Jesus as a passionate Jew, a violent revolutionary, a fanatical ideologue, an odd and scary and extraordinarily interesting man.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Judith Shulevitz, author of The Sabbath World.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d33e66de90d05fe052574736a2b26cdd5b959b","amp;dn":"Zealot%3A+The+Life+of+Jesus+++%282013+-+Retail+epub+and+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2d33e66de90d05fe052574736a2b26cdd5b959b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,211,62,102,222,144,208,95,224,82,87,71,54,162,178,108,221,91,149,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
