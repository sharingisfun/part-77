It should be just a normal day Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a beach to enjoy with family and friends and the summer is at itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s height. Except today is not a normal day. Today there is no one around. In fact, the only living creatures Cass can see are birds. And a horse. Where is everyone?\nAs Cass struggles to find other survivors in this strange new world where nature is taking back the land, she discovers that being alone might not be the worst thing. It depends on who or what else is out there...\n------------\nSilent Light (Michaela &amp; Trisha #1)\n\nMichaela knew it was a stupid idea to stay at her loverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lake house just days after being dumped by the woman, but she found herself there anyway. The trouble is that she isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only visitor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Trisha, another of MichaelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conquests has invited herself around, just when Michaela wants to be alone. Worse, this feisty newcomer seems to delight in pushing MichaelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s buttons and soon she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know whether she wants to strangle Trisha Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or kiss her. \nThen there's the distraction of the weird lights over the lake at night, and the haunting sound of a child's laughter, when as far as they know, there isn't a child for miles. Michaela's convinced something is going on and Trisha is looking at her like they should find out what. But what happens when two headstrong women start digging up long-forgotten secrets and can they pull together long enough to survive finding out?\n----------\nShadows Fall (Michaela &amp; Trisha #2)\n\nSeparated by circumstances, Michaela and Trisha are both too stubborn to admit they miss each other. Even TrishaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impulsive phone call for help degenerates into an argument. But why does Trisha need help? Swallowing her pride, Michaela decides she needs to fly back to the States to see what trouble Trisha has gotten herself into this time. \n\nSheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s glad she did. This time itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a stranger in trouble, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TrishaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister, and the trouble is a lot darker that any of them can imagine. This time, the night is filled with shadows, and some of them move on their ownÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n----------\nScarcity\n\nTeresa doesn't mind loneliness. It comes with the territory and she's learned to be particular about her privacy. She's learned that keeping to yourself is always the best option. \n\nUntil Scarcity turns up. Teresa's never met anyone like her and it worries her how much she likes the girl's presence. \n\nWhat happens when two desperate, needy worlds collide?\n--------\nThe Colour of Roses\n\nRosieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mama is sick. When thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no option left but the hospital, RosieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s momÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ex-lover comes to the rescue and brings Rosie, with no other family, to live with her. Rosie loves living with Jo again and they visit her mother every day. But whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to happen to Rosie when a social worker decides that some sorts of families just aren't right?\n-------\nTurning Tide\n\nBetty, married almost fifty years and tired, stares at the spiral made on the beach from rocks and shells. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d seen two women on the beach last night Ã¢â‚¬â€œ had they made this? Taking her annual holiday at the beach with her husband, she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know yet, but the spiral, symbol of regeneration and transformation, is going to make itself felt in her life. The tide is turning...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f30939869f2cc7f7891c60b53bb33100b7ce85fe","amp;dn":"FF+Kate+Genet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f30939869f2cc7f7891c60b53bb33100b7ce85fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,9,57,134,159,44,199,247,137,28,96,181,59,179,49,0,183,206,133,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
