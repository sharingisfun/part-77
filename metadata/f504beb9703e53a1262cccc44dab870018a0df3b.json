It does not extend to offshore (deepwater) construction.\n\nNOTES:\n1 AS 5100 series should be considered for the design of footings for road bridges.\n2 Where the strength or serviceability of an existing structure is to be evaluated, the general principles of this Standard should be applied. The actual properties of the materials in the structure should be used.\n3 durability requirements are appropriate for structures with design life within (20% of the target design life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f504beb9703e53a1262cccc44dab870018a0df3b","amp;dn":"AS+2159-2009+Piling+Design+and+Installation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f504beb9703e53a1262cccc44dab870018a0df3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,4,190,185,112,62,83,161,38,44,204,196,77,171,135,0,24,160,223,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
