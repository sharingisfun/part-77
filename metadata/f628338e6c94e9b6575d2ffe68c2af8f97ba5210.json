The California Roll\n\nMeet Radar Hoverlander, a witty, gifted con artist with the mind of David Mamet, the voice of Tom Robbins, and the morals of a sailor on shore leave. \nWhat do the Merlin Game, the Penny Skim, the Doolally Snadoodle, and the Afterparty Snuke have in common? They're all the work of world-class con artist and master bafflegabber Radar Hoverlander. Radar's been 'on the snuke' since childhood, but he's still looking for his California Roll, the one big scam that'll set him up in sushi for life.\nTrouble arrives in the stunning, sassy package of Allie Quinn - either the last true innocent or a con artist so slick she makes Radar look like a Quaker. Radar's hapless sidekick, Vic Mirplo, a lovable loser who couldn't con a kid out of a candy cane, thinks Radar's being played. But if love is blind, it's also deaf, dumb and stupid, and before Radar knows it, he's sucked into a vortex of double-, triple-, quadruple-crosses that'll either net him his precious California Roll or put him in a hole in the ground.\nAs timeless as a perpetual-motion machine, as timely as a Madoff arraignment, The California Roll brings you deep inside the world of con artistry, where every fact is fiction and the second liar never has a chance.\n\n02.The Albuquerque Turkey\n\nMaster con artist Radar Hoverlander is getting out of the lifeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦unless his old man drags him back in.\n \nAfter their last big con netted them a nice chunk of change, Radar Hoverlander and his grifter girlfriend, Allie Quinn, have vowed to go straight. But RadarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fragile commitment to clean living is put to the test when an oddly hefty lady in red shows up and stalks him through the streets of Santa Fe. Except thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no ladyÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s RadarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dad, Woody Hoverlander, a world class con artist in his own right.\n\nRadar correctly figures if his dad is in drag, he must be in trouble. Woody is on the lam, with a Vegas hard guy after him and a large debt to clear. To help him, Radar must break his vow to leave cons behindÃ¢â‚¬â€and risk losing Allie, who is determined to protect their nest egg and steer clear of bad influences. \n\nRadarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best pal, the usually hapless Vic Mirplo, had started creating art as a con, but now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming into money as his sculptures start to sell.  When Radar needs someone to flash some cash in Vegas and play the reckless gambler so that he can get his father off the hook, he reinvents Mirplo as the ultimate high roller--the Albuquerque Turkey--and dangles him as bait.\n\nArt fraud, casino cons, love, loyalty, and plenty of double- and triple-crossesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦they all prove that the odds of what happens in Vegas staying in Vegas are about as long as Radar Hoverlander staying straight. \n\n03. The Texas Twist\n\nAfter pulling world-class cons in California and New Mexico, Radar Hoverlander and his crew, including girlfriend and grift artist Allie Quinn and their hapless buddy Vic Mirplo, are back in action, this time in Austin. So many rich fools to bamboozle--but is Radar having a crisis of conscience? \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f628338e6c94e9b6575d2ffe68c2af8f97ba5210","amp;dn":"Radar+Hoverlander+Series+-+John+Vorhaus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f628338e6c94e9b6575d2ffe68c2af8f97ba5210","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,40,51,142,108,148,233,182,87,93,47,254,104,194,175,143,151,186,82,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
