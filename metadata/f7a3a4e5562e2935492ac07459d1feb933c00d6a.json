Her unique sound is characterized by her ability to write from deep vulnerability that translates across a wide range of audiences with charming, lighthearted melodies.\nOne year after independently releasing her debut EP, Paper Heart, she is touring all over the southeast, accumulating a devoted fan base. Teaming up with her manager Mark Bryan of Hootie and the Blowfish, Emily signed a licensing deal with All Media Music Group in 2010. This led to an opportunity for her to perform at the Sunset Sessions in Carlsbad, CA alongside acclaimed bands and artists including REM, Stevie Nicks, Iron and Wine, and Augustana in February of 2011, as well as opening for Hootie and the Blowfish, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, and Darius Rucker.\nShe released a music video for her song &quot;Rooftop&quot; in February 2011 co-starring Bill Murray.
