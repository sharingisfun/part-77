Some speculate it was in revenge for his son being removed as Marvel EIC. However the line folded in mid-1975 despite it drawing some of the best in the biz at the time including Neal Adams, Howard Chaykin, Alex Toth, Steve Ditko, Rich Buckler, John Severin, Michael Fleisher, Russ Heat h, Wally Wood, Walter Simonson, Larry Lieber and Mike Sekowsky who where drawn by generous rates, return of original art, and creator rights (long before Image).\n\nAtlas promised much but the schedule and content suffered from ego and creative problems between the managers, editors and creators. Eventually the whole thing ceased. Only the mens magazine 'Swank' would survive from Seaboard's titles.\n\nThe demise of Atlas did lead to change across the industry though with Marvel and DC began to start returning original art and offering better rates to creators. Also the Atlas challenge to the Comics Code led to the further crumbling of the censorship system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7d3394db19d2e49cb9c94abf3f240220b41f573","amp;dn":"The+Destructor+%23+1%2C+2+%26amp%3B+4+%28Atlas%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7d3394db19d2e49cb9c94abf3f240220b41f573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,211,57,77,177,157,46,73,203,156,148,171,243,242,64,34,11,65,245,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
