Willie Dear\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“As a brand, Ã¢â‚¬Å“country musicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is as meaningless and problematic as words like Ã¢â‚¬Å“indie,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“alternativeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“rootsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ music. And despite the implications of a name like Little Country Giants, to dismiss the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amalgamation of stark and artfully rustic tones simply as Ã¢â‚¬Å“country musicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ denies a great many things. Throughout the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proper debut, a self-released album titled Breaking Hearts &amp; Living Free, a slow and captivating interplay unfolds between Russell and Cameron - the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core songwriters - invoking a pastiche of musical mile-markers. Live, the group is filled out by guitarist Joseph and backup vocalist Julie Evans, with occasional contributions from other performers. Just as the group relies on its own devices to lead the way, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the marriage of such an innovative approach with a traditional country mythos that sets Little Country Giants apart.&quot; -Chad Radford (Flagpole Magazine)\n\nThe Little Country Giants were voted AtlantaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Best Traditional Folk Act in Creative Loafing Best of 2005 edition. They are currently touring the southeast promoting their latest release, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sing Pretty for the PeopleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThe Little Country Giants formed in 2004 and are the product of years of writing songs together and apart, and the music is as pure and simple as it is true and timeless. Unlike most music today that folks might quickly outgrow, this is music one can grow old with. The southern flavor in the songs are rich with the sounds of GeorgiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roots and AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical seeds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f80e7c039a0799b2f979d1898ec1e14e0ec711a5","amp;dn":"Little+Country+Giants+-+Sing+Pretty+for+the+People+%5B2006%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f80e7c039a0799b2f979d1898ec1e14e0ec711a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,14,124,3,154,7,153,178,249,121,209,137,142,193,225,78,14,199,17,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
