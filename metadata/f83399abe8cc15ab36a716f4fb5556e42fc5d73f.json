The mysteries of modern romance are discussed in &quot;Queer For Cat&quot; and the scathing &quot;Let's Kill All The Rock Stars&quot; speaks for itself. In some ways, Big Rude Jake are closer to their historical forefathers Louis Jordan and Wynonnie Harris than many of their ilk--Harris and Jordan did topical songs with a strong shot of satire, not to mention a healthy dose of leering (but good-natured) lust for the fruits of the tree of Love. The music has more of a rock and roll whomp to it than the neo-Swing-set, and Jake sounds a bit like ex-Wall Of Voodoo singer Stan Ridgway. A good time will be had by all, but don't neglect the old masters (like Harris, Jordan, Louis Prima, Jimmy Liggins and Ella Mae Morse).
