They haven't had sex yet and they don't intend to. As it turned out, the only way to make their parents get off their backs about trying to &quot;find someone&quot; was actually finding somoneÃ¢â‚¬â€with whom to put marriage for show. Mutsuki is stictly gay and has a boyfriend, while Shoko is a clinical case of emotional instability who's in no shape for a relationship. They've each found in the other a perfect partner for a sham marriage. Since the conspirators' parents know of their own child's undesirability, but not the spouse's, the union manages to please them. And while the newlyweds hope, in their own way, to live happily ever after, they inevitably come face to face with the fact that no marriage real or staged, is a fairy tale.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f99da7f6064e1ec3b675e513a00baa87fbbf7e76","amp;dn":"Twinkle+Twinkle+-+Emi+Shimokawa.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f99da7f6064e1ec3b675e513a00baa87fbbf7e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,157,167,246,6,78,30,195,182,117,229,19,160,11,170,135,251,191,126,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
