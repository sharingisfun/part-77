With the sound of 'Kalopsia', producer duo The Blizzard propelled itself from rising talents to a hot-shot name. Lars Nyheim and Tore Vatle Jensen are the masterminds behind this project, who made a big impact with their recognisable and significant melodic sways and deep, emotional prog-trance. So here they are today, looking back on an incredible ride of music. And we look back upon history with them. 'Best of The Blizzard' brings the hits, the hidden gems and the remixes. 'Piercing The Fog', 'Iselilja' and of course 'Kalopsia'. Collaborations with Omnia, Susana, Daniel van Sand, Jaren, as well as remixes for Armin van Buuren, Envio, Mike Foyle and more! Timeless classics (to be)!\n\n         &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.beatport.com/release/best-of-the-blizzard/1155063&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.beatport.com/release/best-of-the-blizzard/1155063&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n01.
