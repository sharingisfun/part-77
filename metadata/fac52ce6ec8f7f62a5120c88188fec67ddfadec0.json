House Republicans are attempting to delay the implementation of Obamacare for at least a year as the destructive nature of the &quot;law&quot; becomes even more obvious. \n\nFox News correspondent-at-large Geraldo Rivera joins the show to discuss the current gridlock in Congress. \n\nNew York Times best-selling author Dr. Jerome R. Corsi also joins the show to break down these developments within the Washington beltway. Dr. Corsi is also the author of Who Really Killed Kennedy? 50 Years Later: Stunning New Revelations About the JFK Assassination.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
