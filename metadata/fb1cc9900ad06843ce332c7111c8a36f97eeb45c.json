Which was a lot of chedda back in them days!\n\nThe series was published in 1986-87, with an issue roughly every six months. It was &quot;hosted&quot; by Jay Endicott, the bailbondsman/secret ID of Crossfire, and written and illustrated by Mark Evanier and Dan Spiegle.\n\nProps to the creative team and the scanners!
