The story opens in 1850 with the return of U.S. notary Adam Ewing from the Chatham Islands to his native California. During the trip, Ewing befriends a doctor, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat a rare disease caused by a brain parasite ... Suddenly, the action moves to 1931 in Belgium, where Robert Frobisher, a composer who has been disinherited bisexual, is introduced into the home of a sick artist, his seductive wife, and his nubile daughter ... From there jump to the West Coast in the early seventies, when Luisa Rey uncovers a web of greed and murder that threatens his life ... And, likewise, with equal mastery, traveled to the ignominious England of today, a near future Korean superstate ruled by unfettered capitalism and finally to Hawaii, to Iron Age post-apocalyptic corresponding to the last days of history.\n\nProduction notes:\n- Adapted from the novel by David Mitchell, a collection of six short stories each set in a different time, using their own language and many other narrative forms, but intertwined by the same concept and final message, and we move from the nineteenth century to a distant post-apocalyptic future relating the stories to each other because each one is read or seen by the protagonist of happens next.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb4447365b5596ef85dd63b8cdcd4ce2504bf3cd","amp;dn":"Cloud+Atlas+%282012%29+%5BMICROHD+1080p%5D+%5BDUAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb4447365b5596ef85dd63b8cdcd4ce2504bf3cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,68,71,54,91,85,150,239,133,221,99,184,205,205,76,226,80,75,243,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
