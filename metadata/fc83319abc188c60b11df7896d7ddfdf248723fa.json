Reitman tells a spellbinding story of a larger-than-life personality whose quirks, ticks and charisma shaped AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s newest homegrown religious movement.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Washington Post\nScientology is known for its celebrity believers and its team of Ã¢â‚¬Å“volunteer ministersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at disaster sites such as the World Trade Center; its notably aggressive response to criticism or its attacks on psychiatry; its requirement that believers pay as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars to reach the highest levels of salvation. But for all its notoriety, Scientology has remained AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s least understood new religion, even as it has been one of its most successful.\n\nNow Janet Reitman tells its riveting full story in the first objective modern history of Scientology, at last revealing the astonishing truth about life within the controversial religion for its members and ex-members. Based on five years of research, confidential documents, and extensive interviews with current and former Scientologists, this is an utterly compelling work of nonfiction and the defining work on an elusive faith.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A meticulously researched history and revealing exposÃƒÂ©, a frightening portrait of a religion that many find not just controversial, but dangerous.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Boston Globe\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book is fearless.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Wall Street Journal\n\nA New York Times Notable Book\nAmazon.com Best Books of 2011, Nonfiction\nSan Francisco Chronicle Top Ten of 2011\n\nKirkus Reviews\nThoroughly engrossing page-turner on the shape-shifting Church of Scientology and its despotic, possibly criminal hierarchy.\n\nRolling Stone contributing editor Reitman based this debut on an award-winning article she wrote for that magazine in 2006 amid a flurry of media interest in the normally press-averse organization as it launched an antic publicity campaign featuring the world's most famous Scientologist, Tom Cruise. For most of its 50-plus-year history, Scientology not only avoided attention; it viciously attacked anyone who dared come after it with every means, legal and otherwise, at its disposal. Some say it has even managed to get away with murder (or manslaughter), indentured servitude of minors, brainwashing and the stalking of apostates. So how did such a notoriously thin-skinned and anti-social belief system acquire any believers at all? Reitman delves into the pop-psychology, positive-thinking origins of the cult in the early '50s in the mind of science-fiction hack, truth-bender and would-be commodore of the planet L. Ron Hubbard. A complex, Ponzi-like structure of franchises and a catechism called the Bridge to Total Freedom requiring steep payment from pilgrims at every point along the way resulted in rapid financial growth. As the cult grew in size, its founder took to the sea, creating a society resembling a sci-fi dystopia, designed both to exalt himself and evade tax laws on the land. After Hubbard died an isolated and paranoid hermit, a young man named David Miscavige muscled his way to the top with the blunt aplomb of a Stalinist apparatchik, punctuating his ascendancy with consequent purges of perceived rivals. Reitman somehow manages to maintain an objective stance throughout the book. One of her sources is a charmingly (and surprisingly) independent-minded young second-generation Scientologist named Natalie, whom the author posits as representing an alternative, more recognizably human future of the churchÃ¢â‚¬â€if the top dogs don't first succeed in blowing it all to bits.\n\nA bizarre and complicated history told with masterful control.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc83319abc188c60b11df7896d7ddfdf248723fa","amp;dn":"Janet+Reitman+-+Inside+Scientology+%5BV0%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc83319abc188c60b11df7896d7ddfdf248723fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,131,49,154,188,24,140,96,177,29,247,137,109,125,223,223,36,135,35,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
