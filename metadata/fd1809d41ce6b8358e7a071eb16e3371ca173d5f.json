Pictures' and Legendary Pictures' &quot;The\nDark Knight Rises&quot; is the epic conclusion to filmmaker\nChristopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. It has been\neight years since Batman vanished into the night,\nturning, in that instant, from hero to fugitive.\nAssuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey\nDent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what \nhe and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the \ngreater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal \nactivity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight \nof the anti-crime Dent Act. But everything will change \nwith the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a \nmysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is \nthe emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose \nruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-\nimposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl\nagain, Batman may be no match for Bane.\n\n\n\nActors:                          Directors:                        Producers:\nChristian Bale                   Christopher Nolan                 Emma Thomas\nAnne Hathaway                                                      Charles Roven\nTom Hardy                                                          Christopher Nolan\nMarion Cotillard                                                   \nJoseph Gordon-Levitt\nMichael Caine\nGary Oldman\nMorgan Freeman                   Screenwriters:\n                                 Jonathan Nolan\n                                 Christopher Nolan\n\n\nInformation:\nStudio - Warner Bros.\nGenre - Action &amp; Adventure\nReleased - 2012\nRun Time - 2 hr 44 min\nFormat - Protected  MPEG-4 video file (Widescreen)\nRated - PG-13 for intense sequence of \nviolence and action, some sensuality\nand language\n\n\nLanguage:\nDolby Digital 5.1 - English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd1809d41ce6b8358e7a071eb16e3371ca173d5f","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Knight+Rises+%28HD%29+%5BPG-13%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd1809d41ce6b8358e7a071eb16e3371ca173d5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,24,9,212,28,230,184,53,142,122,7,30,177,110,51,113,202,23,61,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
