A decade-long celebration of growth and power, fueled by the victory in WWII. Based on Pulitzer Prize winner David Halbertstam's bestselling book, this lively series casts a nostalgic eye back on the years of Ozzie and Harriet and the Hula Hoop, years which nonetheless paved the way for the turmoil of the decades to follow. From Sputnik to Elvis, bobby-socks to the Kinsey Report, DAVID HALBERTSTAM'S THE FIFTIES is a breathtaking collage of the people, music, memories, fads and issues that sent the first Baby Boomers on their way. Countless interviews, clips from landmark TV shows and movies and specially-produced music videos set to original '50's hits capture the intense tapestry of optimism and fear, repression and discovery that was THE FIFTIES.\n\n\nEpisode 3 - Let's Play House\n\nA decade comes clean in the third installment of Pulitzer Prize-winning author David Halberstam's series. Conforming to the idealized visions of family as depicted on their new televisions, Americans settle into enjoying the American Dream, but discordant voices are beginning to be heard. Grace Metallious's &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, Sloan Wilson's &quot;The Man In The Gray Flannel Suit&quot; and the opinions of feminists like Betty Friedan begin to make Americans question the hidden burden of having the &quot;perfect&quot; family.\n\n\nVideo \nVHSRip\nID : 0 \nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5 \nFormat settings, BVOP : 2 \nFormat settings, QPel : No \nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263) \nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream \nCodec ID : XVID \nCodec ID/Hint : XviD \nDuration : 54mn 13s \nBit rate : 3 947 Kbps \nWidth : 640 pixels \nHeight : 480 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3 \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nCompression mode : Lossy \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.429 \nStream size : 1.49 GiB (94%) \nWriting library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01) \n\nAudio \nID : 1 \nFormat : MPEG Audio \nFormat version : Version 1 \nFormat profile : Layer 3 \nCodec ID : 55 \nCodec ID/Hint : MP3 \nDuration : 54mn 13s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 256 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 99.3 MiB (6%) \nAlignment : Split accross interleaves \nInterleave, duration : 33 ms (1.00 video frame) \nInterleave, preload duration : 500 ms \nWriting library : LAME3.98.4 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd1b74a29a10da34ff2339beb453e1767f333bae","amp;dn":"History+Channel+-+David+Halberstam%27s+The+Fifties+%281997%29+-+Pt.+3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd1b74a29a10da34ff2339beb453e1767f333bae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,27,116,162,154,16,218,52,255,35,57,190,180,83,225,118,127,51,59,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
