Unbeknownst to John, the train is also carrying Tonto and outlaw Butch Cavendish, who is being transported for his hanging after being apprehended by Dan. Cavendish's gang, however, hijacks the train, which derails soon after, resulting in Butch escaping and Tonto's arrest by John and Dan. The elder Reid recruits John as a Texas Ranger and the two are enlisted to track down the Cavendish gang alongside a group of six other Rangers. A few days into their expedition, the group is ambushed in a canyon by Cavendish's men who kill the Rangers, including Dan, who has his heart cut out by Butch himself. John is injured as well in the attack and dies, only to be found and revived by a white spirit horse (despite pleas from Tonto for &quot;spirit horse to revive warrior brother&quot; [Dan]). When Reid awakens he is informed by Tonto of his new status as a &quot;spirit walker&quot; or one who has been to the other side, Tonto also tells Reid that he cannot be killed in battle and then confirms that one of the Rangers betrayed Dan and is working alongside Butch Cavendish, a &quot;wendigo&quot;. Reid and Tonto hunt for Butch and his gang throughout the desert with a white horse, which is believed to be sacred by the Indians.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd3e1d0930bce05b9d152251dfeab919bd337630","amp;dn":"The+Lone+Ranger+2013+CamXvid.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd3e1d0930bce05b9d152251dfeab919bd337630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,62,29,9,48,188,224,91,157,21,34,81,223,234,185,25,189,51,118,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
