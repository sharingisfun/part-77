Deep into the sonic terrain of worlds past, Origins is an exhaustive collection of authentic, atmospheric historical sounds that will add color to any composerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s palette. Along with a huge collection of multisamples presented in a variety of different dynamics and articulations, the library features a large number of expressive phrases and performances. OriginsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ vivid, dramatic samples promise to add sonic and musical interest to historical and archaeological productions, film scores (especially Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Horror), World Music soundtracks, Left-Field rock and pop, creative remixes and any recordings that require imaginative sound design and innovative textures. Many of the sounds in this collection are available for the first time in any sample library.\n\nThe Instruments:\n\nAncient Horns\nCornus (Roman war horns)\nConches\nCowhorns\nKudu antelope horn\nRamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s horn\nEnglish coach horn\nTibetan horns\n\nFlutes and Pipes\nAulos (Greek reedpipe)\nBalaban (Persian duduk)\nChinese bamboo flute\nBone flute\nDouble pipe (Egyptian zummara)\nDuduk (Armenian reedpipe)\nFilimbi (Tanzanian overtone flute)\nFujara (Slovak contrabass whistle)\nGrass blades\nKaval (Balkan flute)\nNey (middle Eastern flute)\nPibgorn (Welsh reedpipe)\nSorna (Persian shawm)\nSuling (Indonesian flute)\nWhistle tones (various flutes)\n\nStringed\nKantele (Finnish zither)\nKora (West Aftrican harp)\nLaouto (Greek fretted lute)\nMouth bow\nNyatiti (Egyptian lyre)\nOud (Arab lute)\nRabab (middle Eastern long-necked fiddle)\nSantoor (middle Eastern hammered dulcimer)\nSiter (Javanese zither)\n\nMale Vocals\nMen unison\nClusters\nOvertone singing (Mongolia)\nShaman songs and overtones\nSlave chant\nSolo male chants\nSolo male random notes\n\nGroup Vocals\nMen unison\nWomen unison\nCelebration vocal sounds\nFemale lamentation sounds\nWomensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ screams\nWar shouts\n\nAmbient Percussion (recorded in large ambient space)\nOrchestral bass drums (3)\nTimpani (detuned Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5 pitches)\nGong drum\nTam Tams\nEarth gong\nCowbells\nChinese chung (small hand cymbals)\nCeng ceng (Balinese small hand cymbals)\nCrotales\nTurkish davul\nTanzania drum\nTabor\nFrame drums\nBougarabou (African drum)\nDaf (Iranian drum)\nMetal pipes\nGas cylinder\nCrumpled metal\nBrake drum\nHorseshoe hits\nMetal scraping and dragging\nOther metal hits and noises\n\nStudio Percussion\nBurmese small gongs\nLogdrum\nSinging bowl (Tibet)\nThunder drum\nHand cymbals (various)\nHand drums (various)\nJingles and finger cymbals (various)\nKurdish davul\nTabor\nTribal drums (Zambian ingoma)\nMiscellaneous percussion\n\nOthers\nPads and drones (made from sustained instruments)\nAnimal noises\nGrass blades bird effects\nGrass blades bestiary\nMonstrous beasts\nSwords &amp; armor\n\nOrigins contains 3.5 GB of all new sounds performed by musicians well-versed in historical playing techniques. \n\nThis is a one-of-a-kind production, formatted for EXS 24 and Giga.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff31195011088217e2bc72e8f966a02a03f6d090","amp;dn":"ILIO+-+Dirk+Campbell%27s+Origins+%5BGIGA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff31195011088217e2bc72e8f966a02a03f6d090","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,49,25,80,17,8,130,23,226,188,114,232,249,102,160,42,3,246,208,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
