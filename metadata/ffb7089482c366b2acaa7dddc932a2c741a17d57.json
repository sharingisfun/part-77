On Double Your House for Half the Money the indomitable property guru helps people to achieve their property dreams without breaking the bank, even in these recession-hit times. In this inspirational series Sarah's out to prove that anyone can have the home they've always dreamed about, even if they can't afford to buy it. By extending, converting, facelifting or drilling down, even the most modest property can become a sensational home. Follow Sarah's rules and people can double their space for half the cost of trading up to that big new house beyond their means. Each episode Sarah helps two families save cash, create a lump of equity in their home and double their space.\n\n\n1)  Leicestershire and Bristol \nThe Ricketts live in an ordinary looking 1980s detached house in Hinckley, Leicestershire but dream of something bigger. Their budget is tight and any overspend will eat into their savings for IVF. Can Sarah keep the family on the straight and narrow or will they run out of cash before their ambitious build project is finished?\nMeanwhile, the Ellis family in Bristol want to convert their damp basement so that they end up with twice as many bedrooms and bathrooms. Unfortunately the basement of their pokey Victorian flat lacks access to natural light. Can Sarah stop the family from pouring money into the ground?\n\n2)  Buckinghamshire and Lincolnshire \nSarah helps Edward and Louise in Buckinghamshire and Lindsey in Lincolnshire, who was born with achondroplasia and wants a bigger kitchen diner that's adapted to suit her restricted height. Edward and Louise Croft-Baker dream of a bigger house in the country that they can't afford. They aim to double the size of their own home instead by building a huge two storey extension at the side. Their garden has a built-in death trap, a two-metre sheer drop, but Sarah suggests a radical redesign and keeps their budget in check. In Stamford in Lincolnshire, Lindsey Adams has Ã‚Â£40,000 to spend on her kitchen extension but is so scared of making the wrong decisions that she's not making any at all. Sarah shows Lindsey amazing kitchen solutions for people of short stature and guides her gently but firmly towards the finish of the build project.\n\n3)  Wembley and Sheffield \nIn north London the Siddiqis want to enlarge their home with not one but three extensions, while the Boyes in Sheffield are halfway through an ambitious Ã‚Â£180,000 revamp. Faez and Shama Siddiqi have three kids and more than 40 relatives who often drop by. In a perfect world their dream house would be almost double the size of their current home. Can Sarah save them from questionable layout choices and keep their budget on track? The Boyes family in Sheffield want to build a fully rendered two-storey extension on their 1930s house. Sarah is keen for the extension to blend in with the existing house but the right render is crucial. Can she convince Louise to take any of her suggestions on board?\n\n4)  Surrey and Liverpool \nSarah helps a family hoping to turn their ugly duckling house into a New England-style dream and a woman who wants to turn a windmill into a luxury home. In Surrey, Stuart Allan, his wife Fiona and their two daughters are desperate for more space. They have saved for nine years to turn their home around. In Liverpool, Vicky Holmstock has an untouched Grade II listed windmill that she dreams of turning into a luxury designer home. Vicky has submitted five planning applications and worked her way through four architects but still hasn't got her permission finalised.\n\n5)  Buckinghamshire and Sydenham \nIn Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, three generations of the Franklin family live on top of each other in a cramped bungalow. They would love to own a spacious two storey house, but their budget doesn't stretch that far. Instead they decide to turn their current home into a family friendly haven. The Riglers in Sydenham, London are desperate to double their bedrooms and bathrooms. They can't build out, so they're building up into the loft. By doing so they will lose all storage space but Sarah is on hand to help them find clever solutions and keep the budget on track.\n\n6)  Whitstable and Christchurch \nIn Whitstable on the Kent coast Maureen Shaw aims to turn her run-down 1960s bungalow into a four-bed family home. But without a tight schedule, Sarah is worried that the budget might slip. In Christchurch in Dorset, Paul and Judith Turner are in the middle of a massive extension project, making for a longer house but without access to any natural light in the middle. Sarah is keen to come up with some practical solutions.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/3194/idsi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/3194/idsi.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/4511/gh81.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/4511/gh81.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/6837/iqy1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/6837/iqy1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img34.imageshack.us/img34/3839/5gss.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img34.imageshack.us/img34/3839/5gss.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/3784/qpbc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/3784/qpbc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/755/s98q.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/755/s98q.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/8575/orpv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/8575/orpv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/2910/j480.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/2910/j480.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/7517/krhc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/7517/krhc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5b13323c331b1768756b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1939 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 48mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: average 656 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/double-your-house-for-half-the-money&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/double-your-house-for-half-the-money&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffb7089482c366b2acaa7dddc932a2c741a17d57","amp;dn":"Ch4+Double+Your+House+for+Half+the+Money+Series+1+3of6+PDTV+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffb7089482c366b2acaa7dddc932a2c741a17d57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,183,8,148,130,195,102,178,172,170,125,221,201,50,162,199,65,161,125,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
